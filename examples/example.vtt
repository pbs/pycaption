When we think

we have this vision of Einstein

as an old, wrinkly man

00:20.887 --> 00:26.760
MAN 2:
E equals m c-squared is
not about an old Einstein.

It's actually about

even a sexy Einstein.

It is my great ambition

that in any transformation,

no amount of matter, no mass,

to an object

01:33.893 --> 01:36.930
a vague and immeasurable
force like vis viva?

01:36.930 --> 01:39.566
It is a return
to the old ways!

01:39.566 --> 01:42.969
Are you capable of discovering
something of your own?

01:42.969 --> 01:44.637
I discovered you!

We can't harbor
a Jew!

shut us all down!

NARRATOR:
A hundred years ago,

03:00.780 --> 03:03.950
a deceptively simple formula
revealed a hidden unity

03:03.950 --> 03:06.352
buried deep in the fabric
of the universe.

03:10.557 --> 03:13.893
It tells
of a fantastic connection

03:13.893 --> 03:16.596
between energy,
matter and light.

03:18.798 --> 03:22.635
Its author was
a youthful Albert Einstein.

03:22.635 --> 03:26.873
It's the most famous equation
in the world:

03:26.873 --> 03:31.678
E equals m c-squared.

03:33.646 --> 03:35.715
MAN:
All aboard!

03:38.484 --> 03:40.687
( train whistle toots )

03:40.687 --> 03:42.889
LITHGOW:
But while we've all heard

03:42.889 --> 03:44.591
of Einstein's big idea,

03:44.591 --> 03:47.126
very few of us know
what it means.

03:49.896 --> 03:54.467
In fact, E equals m c-squared
is so remarkable

03:54.467 --> 03:58.771
that even Einstein wasn't sure
if it was really true.

04:02.108 --> 04:03.409
WOMAN:
Albert, darling,

04:03.409 --> 04:06.446
you're later than I expected.

04:08.248 --> 04:10.516
We've only got sausage
and cheese tonight.

04:12.318 --> 04:13.686
What is it?

04:13.686 --> 04:15.855
We need to talk.

04:15.855 --> 04:17.290
Has something happened?

04:17.290 --> 04:18.157
Oh, no, nothing.

04:18.157 --> 04:19.926
Sorry, no.

04:19.926 --> 04:21.828
I spent most of the day

04:21.828 --> 04:26.099
staring out
the window at work
looking at trains,

04:26.099 --> 04:27.267
and I started
to think

04:27.267 --> 04:32.305
about an object
and how much energy it had.

04:32.305 --> 04:33.406
Can I explain it to you?

04:33.406 --> 04:34.574
Of course you can.

04:34.574 --> 04:37.277
But first...
( kisses ) dinner!

04:37.277 --> 04:39.112
Hmm? Food, then talk.

04:42.548 --> 04:45.351
I think the gods
are laughing at me.

04:48.855 --> 04:52.325
LITHGOW:
The gods were not laughing
at Einstein.

04:52.325 --> 04:56.329
He'd united
in one stunning insight

04:56.329 --> 04:59.432
the work of many
who had come before him--

04:59.432 --> 05:02.969
scientists who'd fought
and even died

05:02.969 --> 05:06.039
to create each part
of the equation.

05:06.039 --> 05:08.908
The story
of E equals m c-squared

05:08.908 --> 05:11.377
starts long before Einstein

05:11.377 --> 05:14.681
with the discovery
of Efor energy.

05:27.827 --> 05:29.629
In the early 19th century,

05:29.629 --> 05:33.700
scientists didn't think
in terms of energy;

05:33.700 --> 05:38.905
they thought in terms of
individual powersor forces.

05:38.905 --> 05:42.175
These were all disconnected,
unrelated things:

05:42.175 --> 05:46.512
the power of the wind,
the force of a door closing,

05:46.512 --> 05:48.281
a crack of lightning.

05:48.281 --> 05:49.415
( thunder rumbles )

05:49.415 --> 05:50.717
The idea that there might be

05:50.717 --> 05:54.287
some sort of overarching,
unifying energy

05:54.287 --> 05:59.559
which lay behind all these
forces had yet to be revealed.

05:59.559 --> 06:01.361
One lowly man's drive

06:01.361 --> 06:04.464
to understand the hidden
mysteries of nature

06:04.464 --> 06:06.799
would begin to change all that.

06:13.506 --> 06:16.576
MAN:
Young Michael Faraday hated
his job.

06:16.576 --> 06:19.112
He was uneducated,
the son of a blacksmith.

06:19.112 --> 06:22.115
He'd been lucky to become
a bookbinder's apprentice.

06:24.050 --> 06:25.651
But Faraday craved one thing.

06:25.651 --> 06:26.719
He craved knowledge.

06:26.719 --> 06:29.055
He read every book
that passed through his hands.

06:29.055 --> 06:31.090
He developed
a passion for science.

06:32.291 --> 06:35.128
All of his free time
and his meager wages were poured

06:35.128 --> 06:36.529
into his self-education.

06:36.529 --> 06:38.965
He was on the threshold
of an incredible journey

06:38.965 --> 06:41.167
into the invisible world
of energy.

06:54.614 --> 06:58.117
LITHGOW:
Faraday had impressed
one of his master's customers

06:58.117 --> 07:01.821
and was rewarded with a ticket
that would change his life.

07:01.821 --> 07:03.856
Excuse me, please.

07:03.856 --> 07:05.858
Can I pass, please?

07:06.993 --> 07:09.028
Can I pass?

07:09.028 --> 07:11.831
Some of us are trying
to improve ourselves,

07:11.831 --> 07:14.434
if people will let us.

07:14.434 --> 07:15.935
Of course, of course--
pass, pass.

07:17.136 --> 07:18.371
This way
to a better life.

07:18.371 --> 07:19.672
( chuckles )

07:19.672 --> 07:24.143
MAN:
In the early 1800s, science was
the pursuit of gentlemen,

07:24.143 --> 07:27.947
something Faraday
was clearly not.

07:27.947 --> 07:30.349
He had a rudimentary education,

07:30.349 --> 07:35.721
he'd read widely,
he'd gone to public lectures,

07:35.721 --> 07:39.459
but in 1812 he was given tickets
to hear Sir Humphry Davy,

07:39.459 --> 07:42.161
the most prominent chemist
of the age.

07:45.631 --> 07:46.999
( groans )

07:46.999 --> 07:50.136
( laughing )

07:50.136 --> 07:54.841
LITHGOW:
Nineteenth-century scientists
were the pop stars of their day.

07:54.841 --> 07:57.410
Their lectures were
hugely popular.

07:57.410 --> 08:03.082
Tickets were hard to come by,
and Davy reveled in his status.

08:03.082 --> 08:04.484
They're waiting.

08:04.484 --> 08:06.052
I know.

08:07.820 --> 08:12.058
LITHGOW:
He was also a keen follower
of the latest fashion--

08:12.058 --> 08:15.361
nitrous oxide, or laughing gas.

08:15.361 --> 08:20.099
He said it had all the benefits
of alcohol without the hangover.

08:20.099 --> 08:22.735
( laughing )

08:22.735 --> 08:23.769
( clears throat )

08:23.769 --> 08:26.005
Electricity, ladies
and gentlemen,

08:26.005 --> 08:29.275
a mysterious force that can
unravel the confusing mixture

08:29.275 --> 08:31.577
of intermingled substances

08:31.577 --> 08:35.748
that surround us and produce
pure... pure elements!

08:35.748 --> 08:39.185
GATES:
Davy was an absolutely
first-rate scientist.

08:39.185 --> 08:40.920
However, many will come to say

08:40.920 --> 08:43.556
that his greatest discovery is
Michael Faraday.

08:43.556 --> 08:45.691
DAVY:
Metals-- unknown, that is,

08:45.691 --> 08:50.196
until I isolated potassium
from molten potash and sodium,

08:50.196 --> 08:52.365
as I showed you last time,
from common salt.

08:52.365 --> 08:54.600
( voice fades ):
That same magical electric...

08:54.600 --> 08:57.603
LITHGOW:
Faraday may not have been born
a gentleman,

08:57.603 --> 09:00.540
but he wasn't going to let
class barriers stop him

09:00.540 --> 09:03.276
from pursuing
a career in science.

09:05.511 --> 09:06.913
He worked for nights on end

09:06.913 --> 09:12.218
to bind his lecture notes
into a book for his new hero.

09:13.653 --> 09:18.925
FARADAY:
Lord, help me to think
only of others...

09:18.925 --> 09:21.894
to be of use to mankind.

09:21.894 --> 09:24.230
Help me be part
of the great circle

09:24.230 --> 09:26.465
that is your work and love.

09:28.200 --> 09:30.369
Lord, I am your servant.

09:37.543 --> 09:39.579
This is excellent work, Faraday.

09:40.947 --> 09:44.750
So, what is it you aim
to do with your life?

09:44.750 --> 09:48.321
My desire, sir, is
to escape from trade,

09:48.321 --> 09:50.823
which I find vicious
and selfish,

09:50.823 --> 09:52.792
and to become
a servant of science,

09:52.792 --> 09:58.297
which, I imagine, makes its
pursuers amiable and liberal.

09:58.297 --> 09:59.332
( laughs briefly )

10:01.267 --> 10:02.401
Really?

10:02.401 --> 10:04.937
Well, I shall leave it
to the experience of a few years

10:04.937 --> 10:06.272
to set you right on that score.

10:06.272 --> 10:09.542
Look, I haven't anything
at the moment.

10:09.542 --> 10:12.244
I'll send a note
if anything comes up.

10:16.916 --> 10:19.151
LITHGOW:
Despite this
humiliating setback,

10:19.151 --> 10:23.389
Faraday was determined to
break free from his daily toil.

10:26.492 --> 10:28.995
His patience was rewarded.

10:38.471 --> 10:40.039
( explosion, then Davy screams )

10:49.348 --> 10:50.416
DAVY:
Newman...

10:50.416 --> 10:52.818
meet Mr. Michael
Faraday.

10:52.818 --> 10:55.988
He's going to be my helper
while I recover.

10:55.988 --> 10:59.058
He assures me he is
a Christian fellow.

10:59.058 --> 11:01.894
Perhaps with God
and Faraday in charge
of the chemicals,

11:01.894 --> 11:04.096
you and I will be safe
in our place of work.

11:04.096 --> 11:06.499
Thank you,
Professor Davy.

11:06.499 --> 11:07.566
Welcome, Faraday.

11:07.566 --> 11:09.001
Oh, no, thank you,

11:09.001 --> 11:10.569
and thank you,
Sir Humphry.

11:10.569 --> 11:12.271
Just stick to your job
and do as you're told

11:12.271 --> 11:14.173
and you'll be fine, Faraday.

11:19.712 --> 11:25.051
LITHGOW:
Faraday became the laboratory
assistant, eagerly absorbing

11:25.051 --> 11:29.388
every scrap of knowledge
that Davy deigned to impart.

11:29.388 --> 11:33.359
But in time, the pupil
would surpass the master.

11:38.864 --> 11:42.201
The big excitement of the day
was electricity.

11:42.201 --> 11:44.537
Another charge, Newman.

11:44.537 --> 11:46.672
LITHGOW:
The battery
had just been invented,

11:46.672 --> 11:50.643
and all manner of experiments
were being done.

11:50.643 --> 11:52.378
But no one really understood

11:52.378 --> 11:57.316
what this strange force
of electricity was.

11:58.918 --> 12:01.454
GATES:
The academic establishment
at the time thought

12:01.454 --> 12:04.557
that electricity was, you know,

12:04.557 --> 12:08.327
like a fluid flowing through
a pipe, pushing its way along.

12:08.327 --> 12:11.097
But in 1821,
a Danish researcher showed

12:11.097 --> 12:14.633
that when you pass an electric
current through a wire

12:14.633 --> 12:16.435
and place a compass near it,

12:16.435 --> 12:19.772
it deflected the needle
at right angles.

12:19.772 --> 12:21.340
LITHGOW:
This was the first time

12:21.340 --> 12:24.543
researchers had seen electricity
affect a magnet,

12:24.543 --> 12:26.145
the first glimpse of two forces

12:26.145 --> 12:29.749
which had previously been seen
as entirely separate

12:29.749 --> 12:32.785
now unified
in some inexplicable way.

12:32.785 --> 12:34.053
Faraday, come
look at this.

12:34.053 --> 12:35.955
You're the bright
spark around here.

12:35.955 --> 12:37.456
Perhaps you
can work it out.

12:37.456 --> 12:40.159
Oersted's reported
an amazing finding.

12:40.159 --> 12:41.861
We're just
replicating it here.

12:41.861 --> 12:44.897
Let's try the compass
on the other side.

12:47.900 --> 12:49.602
MAN:
Now, that is

12:49.602 --> 12:51.470
remarkable.

12:51.470 --> 12:53.939
But if the electrical force
is flowing through the wire,

12:53.939 --> 12:54.940
why does the needle

12:54.940 --> 12:56.442
not move in
the same direction,

12:56.442 --> 12:57.476
parallel
to the wire?

12:57.476 --> 12:59.478
Quite.

12:59.478 --> 13:03.015
Let's try turning
the whole apparatus round.

13:07.453 --> 13:08.821
Again, Newman.

13:12.458 --> 13:17.763
So, the electrical force goes
this way.

13:17.763 --> 13:20.800
The compass points that way.

13:20.800 --> 13:22.701
How can one affect the other?

13:22.701 --> 13:23.736
( utters sound )

13:24.804 --> 13:28.040
Perhaps the electricity
is throwing out

13:28.040 --> 13:29.208
some invisible force

13:29.208 --> 13:30.309
as it moves
along.

13:30.309 --> 13:31.343
What?

13:31.343 --> 13:35.414
Perhaps some sort of electrical
force is emanating

13:35.414 --> 13:37.016
outwards from
the wire.

13:37.016 --> 13:38.417
Oh, my dear boy, let me tell you

13:38.417 --> 13:40.653
that at
the University of Cambridge,

13:40.653 --> 13:43.088
electricity flows
through a wire,

13:43.088 --> 13:44.723
not sideways to it.

13:44.723 --> 13:46.225
That may be
what they teach
at Cambridge,

13:46.225 --> 13:47.993
but it doesn't explain
what's happening

13:47.993 --> 13:48.994
before our eyes.

13:48.994 --> 13:50.462
No, now, let's just get on.

13:50.462 --> 13:52.898
Let's swap the compass
to below the wire.

13:52.898 --> 13:56.602
LITHGOW:
Why the compass was deflected
at right angles,

13:56.602 --> 13:59.438
why the electricity was
affecting the compass at all,

13:59.438 --> 14:03.042
dumbfounded Davy
and many others.

14:05.578 --> 14:08.848
MINISTER:
As we celebrate the marriage
of Michael and Sarah...

14:08.848 --> 14:13.352
LITHGOW:
For Faraday, however,
the problem became an obsession.

14:13.352 --> 14:16.522
It was a fascination
inspired by his religion.

14:16.522 --> 14:18.724
For him, the problem was a way

14:18.724 --> 14:21.994
to understand God's
hidden mysteries.

14:23.796 --> 14:26.699
BODANIS:
There is a small, almost
persecuted group in London

14:26.699 --> 14:27.933
called the Sandemanians.

14:27.933 --> 14:29.802
They were a religious...
not really a sect,

14:29.802 --> 14:32.104
they were just a small subset,
sort of like Quakers.

14:32.104 --> 14:34.773
Faraday was a member
of that group.

14:34.773 --> 14:36.408
It was a very gentle,
decent group.

14:36.408 --> 14:39.211
They believed that underneath
the whole surface of reality,

14:39.211 --> 14:41.814
everything was created by God
in a unified way;

14:41.814 --> 14:43.816
that if you opened up
one little part of it,

14:43.816 --> 14:45.951
you could see
how everything was connected.

14:50.055 --> 14:51.557
Michael Faraday was someone

14:51.557 --> 14:54.827
who, like Einstein, thought
in terms of pictures.

14:57.162 --> 14:59.698
BODANIS:
Faraday was different
from anybody else.

14:59.698 --> 15:02.534
He had a flair for understanding
his experiments,

15:02.534 --> 15:05.170
for understanding what was
really going on inside them.

15:07.773 --> 15:09.942
LITHGOW:
By methodically placing
a compass

15:09.942 --> 15:11.543
all around an electrified wire,

15:11.543 --> 15:14.246
Faraday started
to notice a pattern.

15:21.587 --> 15:23.555
What everyone else at the time
had been taught

15:23.555 --> 15:25.424
was that forces travel
in straight lines.

15:25.424 --> 15:27.993
Faraday was different.

15:27.993 --> 15:30.262
Faraday imagined
that invisible lines of force

15:30.262 --> 15:31.997
flowed around an electric wire.

15:34.099 --> 15:35.167
And then he imagined

15:35.167 --> 15:37.436
that a magnet had similar lines
emerging from it

15:37.436 --> 15:39.972
and that those lines would get
caught up in this flow.

15:39.972 --> 15:42.374
It was a bit
like a flag in a wind.

15:46.412 --> 15:49.381
LITHGOW:
But Faraday's great leap
of imagination

15:49.381 --> 15:52.518
was to turn this experiment
on its head.

15:52.518 --> 15:55.955
Instead of an electrified wire
moving a compass needle,

15:55.955 --> 16:00.592
he wondered if he could get
a static magnet to move a wire.

16:00.592 --> 16:02.361
I've never seen you
like this, Faraday.

16:02.361 --> 16:05.764
( chuckling ):
You look like
a happy child.

16:05.764 --> 16:08.701
I'm shaking, Newman.

16:08.701 --> 16:10.569
Underneath, I'm shaking.

16:18.143 --> 16:19.144
( gasps )

16:19.144 --> 16:20.245
You see, John?

16:21.246 --> 16:22.314
You see?

16:22.314 --> 16:23.048
Yes.

16:34.760 --> 16:38.330
GATES:
This is the experiment
of the century.

16:38.330 --> 16:40.933
It's the invention
of the electric motor.

16:40.933 --> 16:43.569
Scale up the magnets
and the wires,

16:43.569 --> 16:47.439
make them really big,
attach heavy weights to them

16:47.439 --> 16:50.009
and they'll be dragged along.

16:50.009 --> 16:51.877
But almost more importantly,

16:51.877 --> 16:54.680
he's inventing
a new kind of physics here.

16:55.914 --> 16:58.417
LITHGOW:
Although he didn't realize it
at the time,

16:58.417 --> 17:01.520
Faraday had also
just demonstrated

17:01.520 --> 17:03.789
an overarching principle.

17:03.789 --> 17:05.657
The chemicals in the battery

17:05.657 --> 17:08.761
had been transformed
into electricity in the wire,

17:08.761 --> 17:13.932
which had combined with
the magnet to produce motion.

17:13.932 --> 17:19.772
Behind all these various forces
there was a common energy.

17:31.150 --> 17:32.851
BODANIS:
A couple of months earlier,

17:32.851 --> 17:35.621
Davy had been elected president
of the Royal Society,

17:35.621 --> 17:38.991
which was the elite body
of English science.

17:38.991 --> 17:40.726
But then he saw
this great discovery

17:40.726 --> 17:42.995
published in the Quarterly
Journal of Science.

17:42.995 --> 17:44.396
I don't know if he was envious,

17:44.396 --> 17:46.298
but he certainly saw
that this young man

17:46.298 --> 17:49.234
who had been his assistant,
this mere blacksmith's son,

17:49.234 --> 17:51.537
had come up with one
of the greatest discoveries

17:51.537 --> 17:53.105
of the Victorian era.

17:59.311 --> 18:04.416
Davy accuses Faraday
of plagiarizing similar work

18:04.416 --> 18:08.587
from another eminent British
scientist, William Wollaston.

18:08.587 --> 18:12.357
So, Faraday, what
does Wollaston
make of all this?

18:12.357 --> 18:14.693
He's written to me
and assures me

18:14.693 --> 18:16.261
that he's taken
no offense,

18:16.261 --> 18:18.197
and he acknowledges
that what I published

18:18.197 --> 18:19.832
was entirely my own work.

18:19.832 --> 18:20.899
Quite, quite.

18:20.899 --> 18:23.502
Davy is just
being an ass.

18:23.502 --> 18:25.771
But will Davy now retract
his allegation?

18:25.771 --> 18:27.005
Sadly, no.

18:27.005 --> 18:28.907
In fact, he is still
vehemently opposed

18:28.907 --> 18:30.742
to you being elected
a member of the society.

18:30.742 --> 18:32.945
Really. And what do you think?

18:32.945 --> 18:36.582
Faraday, my dear boy,
you have my vote.

18:36.582 --> 18:37.716
And mine.

18:37.716 --> 18:39.785
And I believe you
even have Wollaston's.

18:39.785 --> 18:42.454
Oh... What a mess!

18:42.454 --> 18:44.022
Well, no matter,
no matter--

18:44.022 --> 18:45.524
it's the science
that counts.

18:45.524 --> 18:46.558
So, tell me,

18:46.558 --> 18:48.894
how does this wire
of yours spin
round its magnet?

18:48.894 --> 18:52.030
What mysterious
forces are at play?

18:52.030 --> 18:57.636
There seems to be
an electromagnetic interaction.

18:57.636 --> 19:00.305
In my mind, I see
a swirling array

19:00.305 --> 19:02.207
of lines of force spinning

19:02.207 --> 19:04.276
out of
the electrified wire

19:04.276 --> 19:07.646
like a spiraling web.

19:07.646 --> 19:09.148
But invisible
lines of force--

19:09.148 --> 19:11.316
it's all a bit vague,
isn't it?

19:11.316 --> 19:13.886
Faraday, might I have
a word in private?

19:15.287 --> 19:16.622
Certainly.

19:28.834 --> 19:29.968
Listen, Faraday,

19:29.968 --> 19:31.503
let's stop
this nonsense.

19:31.503 --> 19:33.672
I want you
to take down
your ballot paper

19:33.672 --> 19:34.773
from the notice board.

19:34.773 --> 19:38.076
Sir Humphry, I see
no reason to take it down.

19:38.076 --> 19:40.979
My friends have
proposed me.

19:40.979 --> 19:42.748
It is they
who put the paper up.

19:42.748 --> 19:44.416
I will not take it down.

19:44.416 --> 19:45.450
Good day.

19:50.989 --> 19:54.560
LITHGOW:
Faraday was elected
to the Royal Society.

19:54.560 --> 19:57.095
Davy died five years later,

19:57.095 --> 20:00.899
a victim of his
many gaseous inhalations.

20:00.899 --> 20:04.570
In time, Faraday's world
of invisible forces would lead

20:04.570 --> 20:07.739
to a whole new
understanding of energy.

20:07.739 --> 20:12.644
He'd started what Einstein would
call the great revolution.

20:19.484 --> 20:24.389
It was in the very heart of this
exciting new world of energy

20:24.389 --> 20:26.858
that Einstein grew up.

20:36.868 --> 20:40.272
EINSTEIN:
My father and uncle wanted
to make their fortune

20:40.272 --> 20:43.408
by bringing electric light
to the streets of Germany.

20:46.144 --> 20:48.914
From an early age,
I loved to look at machines,

20:48.914 --> 20:51.416
understand how things work.

20:54.920 --> 20:56.888
He's going to kill himself.

20:59.491 --> 21:01.827
Albert, stay there.

21:01.827 --> 21:11.603
( man scolding in background )

21:11.603 --> 21:17.276
EINSTEIN:
I experienced a miracle when
my father showed me a compass.

21:17.276 --> 21:20.112
I trembled and grew cold.

21:21.847 --> 21:26.451
There had to be something behind
objects that lay deeply hidden.

21:32.724 --> 21:35.794
At high school, they had their
ideas about what I should learn.

21:35.794 --> 21:37.162
I had my own.

21:37.162 --> 21:38.497
Einstein!

21:38.497 --> 21:41.366
EINSTEIN:
I was merely interested
in physics, maths, philosophy

21:41.366 --> 21:43.535
and playing the violin.

21:43.535 --> 21:46.138
Everything else was a bore.

21:46.138 --> 21:47.139
Einstein!

21:47.139 --> 21:48.707
On your feet!

21:52.010 --> 21:55.213
As you obviously
know everything

21:55.213 --> 21:57.816
about geology,
tell me,

21:57.816 --> 22:01.219
how do the rock strata run here?

22:01.219 --> 22:04.356
It's pretty much the same to me

22:04.356 --> 22:06.391
whichever way they run,
Herr Professor.

22:13.732 --> 22:16.601
LITHGOW:
Einstein's teachers tried
to drum into him,

22:16.601 --> 22:18.337
as Faraday had shown,

22:18.337 --> 22:22.174
that energy could be converted
from one form into another.

22:22.174 --> 22:24.876
They also believed
that all forms of energy

22:24.876 --> 22:26.578
had already been discovered.

22:26.578 --> 22:30.182
Einstein was going
to prove them wrong.

22:30.182 --> 22:33.652
He would discover a new,
vast reservoir of energy,

22:33.652 --> 22:36.855
hidden where no other scientist
had ever thought of looking--

22:36.855 --> 22:40.859
deep in the heart of matter.

22:52.137 --> 22:55.741
A hundred years
before Einstein's birth,

22:55.741 --> 22:59.144
King Louis XV was
on the throne of France.

22:59.144 --> 23:02.481
But the ancient, absolute power
of the monarchy over the people

23:02.481 --> 23:04.182
was starting to be challenged.

23:04.182 --> 23:05.784
MAN:Jacques,

23:05.784 --> 23:06.651
leave the windows.

23:06.651 --> 23:08.153
Forget the rain.

23:08.153 --> 23:09.121
We need air.

23:11.289 --> 23:15.627
LITHGOW:
The French Revolution was
just around the corner.

23:15.627 --> 23:17.596
( thunder rumbles )

23:18.964 --> 23:20.866
WOMAN:
This was the era
of enlightenment,

23:20.866 --> 23:24.169
when intellectuals
believed very firmly

23:24.169 --> 23:26.471
that the way forward
lay in science.

23:26.471 --> 23:28.507
And they felt that
one of the first tasks

23:28.507 --> 23:30.675
that lay ahead of them
was to rationalize

23:30.675 --> 23:33.545
and to classify
every single kind of matter

23:33.545 --> 23:37.082
so they could see how it
all interacted together.

23:37.082 --> 23:41.486
LITHGOW:
Antoine Lavoisier, a wealthy,
aristocratic young man,

23:41.486 --> 23:43.221
decided to take up this task,

23:43.221 --> 23:45.157
to see if there was
some basic connection

23:45.157 --> 23:47.893
between all the stuff
of everyday life:

23:47.893 --> 23:51.196
all the different substances
in the world.

23:55.867 --> 23:59.304
But what worked for Lavoisier
as a scientist--

23:59.304 --> 24:02.908
his meticulous, even obsessive
attention to detail--

24:02.908 --> 24:05.710
was also to be his downfall.

24:08.246 --> 24:12.384
Monsieur Lavoisier, you are,
if my eyes do not deceive me,

24:12.384 --> 24:14.286
consuming only milk
this evening.

24:14.286 --> 24:16.521
First you had a glass of milk,

24:16.521 --> 24:19.224
now you are eating
a bowl of milk.

24:19.224 --> 24:22.260
Will you next move on
to a plate of milk?

24:22.260 --> 24:23.261
( chortles )

24:23.261 --> 24:24.529
LAVOISIER:
Your precise observations

24:24.529 --> 24:27.966
commend you as a lady
of scientific curiosity,

24:27.966 --> 24:29.034
Mademoiselle.

24:29.034 --> 24:30.168
Most unusual.

24:30.168 --> 24:31.436
As you seek knowledge,

24:31.436 --> 24:32.938
so I shall dispense it.

24:32.938 --> 24:37.976
For the last five weeks,
I have taken nothing but milk.

24:37.976 --> 24:40.278
MAN:
Good God, man,

24:40.278 --> 24:42.080
I would rather die than fast

24:42.080 --> 24:43.949
on milk
for five weeks!

24:43.949 --> 24:46.985
Are you in the grip
of some horrendous ailment?

24:46.985 --> 24:48.753
On the contrary.

24:48.753 --> 24:51.623
I am investigating the effects

24:51.623 --> 24:53.925
of diet on health.

24:53.925 --> 24:55.660
MAN:
Monsieur, with the
greatest of respect

24:55.660 --> 24:58.597
to a member of the Royal
Academy of Sciences,

24:58.597 --> 25:02.901
your gut must think
your throat has been slit!

25:04.135 --> 25:05.003
( laughs loudly )

25:06.171 --> 25:09.140
( laughter spreads )

25:09.140 --> 25:12.777
Whereas your gut, Count, is
no doubt petitioning the Academy

25:12.777 --> 25:15.013
for a widening
of your throat.

25:15.013 --> 25:16.014
WOMAN ( gasping ):
Marie Anne!

25:16.014 --> 25:17.616
How dare you

25:17.616 --> 25:19.618
insult
the count?

25:22.787 --> 25:24.489
Don't forget what
the count offers...

25:25.457 --> 25:29.294
not just marriage,
but think

25:29.294 --> 25:30.695
of how you will be introduced

25:30.695 --> 25:31.596
to all the salons.

25:33.598 --> 25:34.599
You will be

25:34.599 --> 25:36.101
the toast of Paris.

25:38.103 --> 25:40.005
LAVOISIER:
Would it not be
a shame, Madame,

25:40.005 --> 25:41.840
to burden you

25:41.840 --> 25:45.944
with the duties of matrimony
before you have had a chance

25:45.944 --> 25:48.313
to experience
your curiosity for nature?

25:50.715 --> 25:53.251
Shall we all go through?

25:53.251 --> 25:56.388
It's getting rather hot in here.

26:04.396 --> 26:06.598
Do you really plan
to marry d'Amerval?

26:06.598 --> 26:08.567
There is a plan,
but it is not mine.

26:08.567 --> 26:10.435
Then I must contrive
to save you.

26:15.907 --> 26:20.145
LITHGOW:
Lavoisier wasn't a scientist
by profession.

26:20.145 --> 26:23.014
He was the head of tax
enforcement in Paris.

26:23.014 --> 26:27.052
His great idea was to build
a huge wall around the city

26:27.052 --> 26:30.055
and to tax everything
that came and went.

26:30.055 --> 26:33.191
But his taxes on the simple
things in life--

26:33.191 --> 26:35.393
bread, wine and cheese--

26:35.393 --> 26:38.530
did not endear him
to the average Parisian.

26:38.530 --> 26:41.866
This scrupulous,
fastidious young man

26:41.866 --> 26:47.072
did still allow himself
the occasional act of passion.

26:49.641 --> 26:54.179
In 1771, Lavoisier married
Marie Anne Paulze,

26:54.179 --> 26:57.616
the daughter of his colleague
in the tax office.

26:59.618 --> 27:02.120
Thus he saved her,
as he had promised,

27:02.120 --> 27:06.591
from an arranged marriage
to a count 40 years her elder.

27:11.730 --> 27:13.798
Allow me to show
you something.

27:19.037 --> 27:22.007
FARA:
Lavoisier, I think, found
his job as a tax collector

27:22.007 --> 27:23.308
really rather tedious,

27:23.308 --> 27:26.044
and the times he looked
forward to were the evenings

27:26.044 --> 27:28.580
and the weekends, when
he could indulge his passion

27:28.580 --> 27:30.849
for chemical experimentation.

27:30.849 --> 27:33.752
And he called those times
his jours de bonheur,

27:33.752 --> 27:35.086
his days of happiness.

27:37.355 --> 27:38.757
Madame.

27:43.094 --> 27:49.668
What will happen if I take a bar
of copper or iron

27:49.668 --> 27:50.568
and leave it outside

27:50.568 --> 27:53.038
in the rain
for months on end,

27:53.038 --> 27:55.573
Madame Lavoisier?

27:55.573 --> 27:56.641
Mmm...

27:56.641 --> 27:58.777
( giggles ):
Monsieur Lavoisier?

27:58.777 --> 27:59.511
The metals--

27:59.511 --> 28:01.880
what will become of them?

28:01.880 --> 28:05.483
Is this a verbal
examination

28:05.483 --> 28:09.254
prior to an examination
proper, sir?

28:09.254 --> 28:11.756
I merely seek the truth.

28:11.756 --> 28:13.525
Then you toy with me,
monsieur,

28:13.525 --> 28:15.560
for you know the truth.

28:15.560 --> 28:19.097
The copper will become covered
in a green verdigris,

28:19.097 --> 28:21.466
and the iron will rust.

28:21.466 --> 28:23.635
I believe the term is

28:23.635 --> 28:25.770
calcined.

28:25.770 --> 28:28.973
Most impressive,
my charming wife.

28:28.973 --> 28:30.308
But let me press
you further.

28:30.308 --> 28:31.509
Hmm?

28:31.509 --> 28:35.313
When the metal rusts,
does it get heavier

28:35.313 --> 28:36.681
or lighter?

28:36.681 --> 28:39.884
Why, sir, I think
you mean to trap me.

28:39.884 --> 28:41.086
Oh.

28:41.086 --> 28:44.189
Then perhaps this little
butterfly should land

28:44.189 --> 28:46.524
and allow me to take
a closer look.

28:46.524 --> 28:50.929
Every last citizen in France
of sensible age knows

28:50.929 --> 28:52.897
that when a metal rusts,
it wastes away,

28:52.897 --> 28:55.100
it gets lighter
and eventually
disappears.

28:55.100 --> 28:56.101
Ah, but...

28:56.101 --> 28:57.569
Ah, stop.

28:57.569 --> 28:59.537
I have not finished.

28:59.537 --> 29:01.639
Contain yourself, sir.

29:01.639 --> 29:03.808
There is more.

29:03.808 --> 29:07.045
In a recently published pamphlet

29:07.045 --> 29:08.880
by a brilliant
young chemist,

29:08.880 --> 29:11.282
Antoine Lavoisier
demonstrates

29:11.282 --> 29:13.685
that the iron combines
with the air.

29:13.685 --> 29:15.720
It, in fact, becomes heavier.

29:15.720 --> 29:17.956
Most impressive.

29:17.956 --> 29:18.923
I intend...

29:18.923 --> 29:21.493
Now, whatever you
intend, monsieur,

29:21.493 --> 29:23.795
I intend to be
by your side.

29:23.795 --> 29:25.530
I will learn all I can
about your science

29:25.530 --> 29:27.465
and become your
worthy colleague.

29:27.465 --> 29:30.869
Then let me show you
how the iron combines
with the air

29:30.869 --> 29:33.371
to form such
a delicate union.

29:33.371 --> 29:35.807
Tomorrow, monsieur.

29:35.807 --> 29:37.842
Tomorrow.

29:52.991 --> 29:55.727
LITHGOW:
Marie Anne learned chemistry
at her husband's side,

29:55.727 --> 30:00.932
but soon sought other ways
to contribute to his work.

30:00.932 --> 30:02.133
She learned English

30:02.133 --> 30:06.070
so that she could translate
contemporary scientific works.

30:06.070 --> 30:07.172
She took drawing lessons

30:07.172 --> 30:10.241
so that she could record
in forensic detail

30:10.241 --> 30:13.344
the minutiae of their work
together.

30:13.344 --> 30:15.547
She ran their laboratory

30:15.547 --> 30:19.384
and was the public face
of Lavoisier, Inc.

30:19.384 --> 30:22.320
She was central
to the whole research effort.

30:23.655 --> 30:25.190
Monsieur,

30:25.190 --> 30:27.192
that is a terrible thing to say.

30:27.192 --> 30:28.226
( giggles )

30:28.226 --> 30:29.661
You are a cheeky man.

30:29.661 --> 30:31.129
( both laugh )

30:31.129 --> 30:32.931
LAVOISIER:
This way, please, gentlemen.

30:41.940 --> 30:43.575
Messieurs...

30:45.677 --> 30:47.545
it is my great ambition

30:47.545 --> 30:53.952
to demonstrate
that nature is a closed system,

30:53.952 --> 30:55.887
that in any transformation,

30:55.887 --> 31:01.292
no amount of matter, no mass
is ever lost

31:01.292 --> 31:03.461
and none is gained.

31:03.461 --> 31:04.662
Over here, please.

31:10.902 --> 31:16.641
This precise amount of water
is heated to steam.

31:16.641 --> 31:18.176
This steam is brought
into contact

31:18.176 --> 31:23.982
with a red-hot iron barrel
imbedded in the coals.

31:25.550 --> 31:29.320
From this end we cool the steam

31:29.320 --> 31:36.127
but, interestingly, we collect
less water than we started with.

31:36.127 --> 31:41.232
So clearly we lose
a certain amount of water.

31:41.232 --> 31:45.937
However, we also collect a gas,

31:45.937 --> 31:49.807
and the weight
of the iron barrel increases.

31:52.210 --> 31:55.413
Now, when we combine
these two increases--

31:55.413 --> 31:56.848
the new weight
of the iron barrel

31:56.848 --> 31:59.183
and the gas we have collected--

31:59.183 --> 32:05.590
they are exactly equal to
the weight of the lost water.

32:05.590 --> 32:07.492
Ah, but is it

32:07.492 --> 32:09.761
atmospheric air,
Monsieur Lavoisier?

32:09.761 --> 32:11.029
No.

32:11.029 --> 32:14.332
No, because I am measuring it
to the very last grain,

32:14.332 --> 32:17.835
I can see that it is lighter
than the air around us

32:17.835 --> 32:19.070
and, moreover...

32:22.440 --> 32:24.108
it is flammable.

32:26.077 --> 32:26.811
( whoosh and pop )

32:26.811 --> 32:27.845
Voil.

32:30.515 --> 32:32.650
BODANIS:
Water is made out of hydrogen
and oxygen.

32:32.650 --> 32:34.552
So what he had done is
get the oxygen to stick

32:34.552 --> 32:37.755
to the inside
of a red-hot iron rifle barrel.

32:37.755 --> 32:40.325
He was basically just making
rust, which is oxygen and iron,

32:40.325 --> 32:42.160
but he was making the rust
really quickly.

32:42.160 --> 32:45.029
Now, that left the hydrogen,
what he called combustible air,

32:45.029 --> 32:46.597
and that was just floating
around as a gas.

32:46.597 --> 32:48.099
( whoosh and pop )

32:48.099 --> 32:49.767
No mass had been lost.

32:49.767 --> 32:51.269
It had merely been transformed,

32:51.269 --> 32:54.872
and now he wanted to transform
it all back into water.

33:01.212 --> 33:02.580
This is only the beginning.

33:02.580 --> 33:04.148
In the next few months
I hope to demonstrate

33:04.148 --> 33:09.153
that I can recombine this
combustible air with vital air

33:09.153 --> 33:12.290
and transform them both
back into water.

33:12.290 --> 33:15.994
I will re-create exactly
the same amount of water

33:15.994 --> 33:17.929
that was lost here
in this process.

33:20.264 --> 33:24.102
It is my hope
to complete the cycle--

33:24.102 --> 33:29.173
water into gas into water...

33:30.842 --> 33:32.443
and not a drop lost.

33:35.780 --> 33:37.648
For a long time,
Lavoisier had suspected

33:37.648 --> 33:39.183
that the exact amount of matter,
the mass

33:39.183 --> 33:42.587
involved in any transformation
was always conserved.

33:42.587 --> 33:44.756
But to prove this,

33:44.756 --> 33:47.291
he had to perform thousands
of experiments,

33:47.291 --> 33:48.626
and he had to do
the measurements

33:48.626 --> 33:50.395
with incredible accuracy.

33:51.963 --> 33:53.498
That's where his great wealth

33:53.498 --> 33:55.366
from being a tax collector
came in.

33:55.366 --> 33:57.435
He could afford to commission

33:57.435 --> 34:00.104
the most sensitive instruments
ever built.

34:02.006 --> 34:04.842
He became
obsessed with accuracy.

34:10.515 --> 34:15.053
LITHGOW:
But Lavoisier's exacting methods
were also starting to anger

34:15.053 --> 34:17.889
the growing mob of hungry,
disenchanted Parisians.

34:17.889 --> 34:20.458
( people yelling )

34:21.559 --> 34:23.194
MARIE ANNE:
Antoine.

34:23.194 --> 34:24.462
Antoine.

34:24.462 --> 34:25.830
Oh, wake up, Antoine.

34:28.800 --> 34:30.902
I'm sorry.

34:32.170 --> 34:34.138
What time is it?

34:34.138 --> 34:36.874
It is almost time
to receive Monsieur Marat.

34:36.874 --> 34:38.042
The Academy asked you

34:38.042 --> 34:40.978
to assess his designs.

34:40.978 --> 34:44.348
He claims to have made
a great discovery.

34:44.348 --> 34:46.584
Oh, Antoine, have you forgotten?

34:47.585 --> 34:48.586
Oh, God.

34:48.586 --> 34:51.689
Another charlatan
with an idea to peddle.

34:51.689 --> 34:53.424
God, give me patience.

35:00.498 --> 35:01.732
( Lavoisier coughs )

35:03.534 --> 35:04.535
Ah, Monsieur Marat.

35:04.535 --> 35:05.903
Monsieur.

35:05.903 --> 35:07.972
I have invented
a device

35:07.972 --> 35:09.440
which projects
an image

35:09.440 --> 35:12.376
of the substance of fire
onto a screen.

35:13.544 --> 35:14.745
You see,

35:14.745 --> 35:19.250
when a lantern is
shone through a flame,

35:19.250 --> 35:22.253
we see a shimmering pattern
above the flame.

35:22.253 --> 35:23.855
My device renders

35:23.855 --> 35:27.792
the substance of fire visible.

35:29.193 --> 35:31.429
Have you collected it,
this substance of fire?

35:31.429 --> 35:33.564
Have you trapped it
and measured it?

35:33.564 --> 35:35.867
Well, no, but...

35:35.867 --> 35:38.136
but one can see it.

35:38.136 --> 35:39.971
I'm sorry.

35:39.971 --> 35:41.772
In the absence
of exact measurements,

35:41.772 --> 35:43.941
of precise observations,

35:43.941 --> 35:45.910
without rigorous reasoning,

35:45.910 --> 35:47.712
one can only be engaging
in conjecture,

35:47.712 --> 35:49.647
so this is not science.

35:50.781 --> 35:52.083
I am not given

35:52.083 --> 35:54.252
to conjecture, monsieur.

35:54.252 --> 35:56.020
No, no.

35:56.020 --> 35:57.321
If you will you excuse me.

35:57.321 --> 35:58.890
I am extremely busy today.

35:58.890 --> 36:00.825
Thank you.

36:00.825 --> 36:02.727
Thank you.

36:02.727 --> 36:04.061
So that is all?

36:06.430 --> 36:07.632
Then good day, monsieur!

36:14.305 --> 36:15.606
( slams on table )

36:27.351 --> 36:30.321
Let me guess, Marat.

36:30.321 --> 36:33.157
The king's
scientific despot
has decreed

36:33.157 --> 36:34.625
that your invention
does not conform

36:34.625 --> 36:36.527
to the version
of the truth

36:36.527 --> 36:40.498
as laid down
by the Academy.

36:40.498 --> 36:43.267
Lavoisier.

36:43.267 --> 36:47.305
He talks about facts,
he worships the truth.

36:47.305 --> 36:49.941
Listen to me, my friend.

36:49.941 --> 36:52.843
They are all the same,
the Royal Academies--

36:52.843 --> 36:55.046
they insult the liberty
of the mind.

36:56.814 --> 37:01.819
They think they are
the sole arbiters of genius.

37:01.819 --> 37:04.488
They are rotten
to the core--

37:04.488 --> 37:09.527
just like every other
tentacle of the king.

37:09.527 --> 37:15.466
The people-- it is they
who will determine
right and wrong.

37:15.466 --> 37:16.734
Don't worry.

37:16.734 --> 37:22.540
In my next pamphlet
I will expose this
persecutor of yours.

37:33.084 --> 37:36.587
LITHGOW:
For years, the Lavoisiers
burned, chopped, melted

37:36.587 --> 37:39.357
and boiled every conceivable
substance.

37:39.357 --> 37:41.592
They'd shown that
as long as one is scrupulous

37:41.592 --> 37:44.762
about collecting all the vapors,
liquids and powders

37:44.762 --> 37:49.734
created in a transformation,
then mass is not decreased.

37:49.734 --> 37:53.504
Liquids might become gases,
metals may rust,

37:53.504 --> 37:56.207
wood may become ash and smoke,

37:56.207 --> 38:00.578
but matter, the tiny atoms
that make up all substances,

38:00.578 --> 38:02.747
none of it is ever lost.

38:03.914 --> 38:05.983
The crowning glory
of this opus was

38:05.983 --> 38:08.953
their remarkable use
of static electricity

38:08.953 --> 38:14.025
to cause oxygen and hydrogen
to recombine back into water.

38:22.900 --> 38:24.168
What is happening?

38:27.371 --> 38:31.909
( explosions in distance )

38:37.715 --> 38:39.917
LITHGOW:
As the French Revolution
exploded,

38:39.917 --> 38:43.654
the royal family
and whole swaths of aristocrats

38:43.654 --> 38:47.358
lost their heads
on the guillotine.

38:51.329 --> 38:53.898
FARA:
To the French revolutionaries
of 1790,

38:53.898 --> 38:56.500
Lavoisier meant one thing
and one thing only:

38:56.500 --> 38:59.570
he was the despised
tax collector

38:59.570 --> 39:01.339
who'd built that wall
around Paris.

39:01.339 --> 39:04.675
LITHGOW:
Lavoisier's job
as a tax collector

39:04.675 --> 39:06.544
brought him under suspicion.

39:06.544 --> 39:07.611
He was denounced

39:07.611 --> 39:11.215
by a failed scientist
turned radical journalist,

39:11.215 --> 39:13.484
Jean Paul Marat.

39:20.891 --> 39:22.293
( pounding at door )

39:25.696 --> 39:28.466
( pounding at door )

39:28.466 --> 39:30.501
( knocking at door )

39:31.869 --> 39:33.137
Ouest Lavoisier?
Je ne sais pas.

39:33.137 --> 39:34.338
Lavoisier!

39:35.306 --> 39:36.340
Lavoisier!

39:52.723 --> 39:54.091
Lavoisier!

40:09.273 --> 40:16.213
( sobbing )

40:30.828 --> 40:35.766
( crowd yelling )

40:35.766 --> 40:38.269
( crowd cheering )

40:38.269 --> 40:39.737
BODANIS:
What Lavoisier did

40:39.737 --> 40:41.439
was absolutely central
to science

40:41.439 --> 40:43.140
and especially
to E equals m c-squared.

40:43.140 --> 40:45.376
Because what he said is,
if you take a bunch of matter,

40:45.376 --> 40:48.512
you can break it apart,
you can recombine it,

40:48.512 --> 40:49.613
you can do anything to it

40:49.613 --> 40:52.883
and the stuff of the matter
won't go away.

40:52.883 --> 40:55.953
If the mob burned Paris
to the ground, utterly razed it,

40:55.953 --> 40:58.055
shattered the bricks
into rubble and dust

40:58.055 --> 41:00.591
and burned the buildings
into ashes and smoke,

41:00.591 --> 41:03.427
it turns out if you put
a huge dome over Paris

41:03.427 --> 41:05.529
and weighed all the smoke
and all the ashes

41:05.529 --> 41:06.764
and all the rubble,

41:06.764 --> 41:10.301
it would add up to the exact
same weight as the original city

41:10.301 --> 41:11.902
and the air around it before.

41:11.902 --> 41:14.038
Nothing disappears.

41:32.823 --> 41:36.961
LITHGOW:
A century later, all of nature
had been classified

41:36.961 --> 41:39.763
into two great domains.

41:39.763 --> 41:43.467
There was energy-- the forces
that animated objects;

41:43.467 --> 41:45.369
and there was mass--

41:45.369 --> 41:48.539
the physical stuff
that made up those objects.

41:48.539 --> 41:51.542
The whole of 19th-century
science rested

41:51.542 --> 41:54.111
on these two mighty pillars.

41:54.111 --> 41:58.983
The laws that governed one
did not apply to the other.

41:58.983 --> 42:03.220
But young, newly enrolled
physics student Albert Einstein

42:03.220 --> 42:05.589
didn't like laws.

42:05.589 --> 42:06.891
Good grief,
Einstein.

42:06.891 --> 42:08.659
What happened
to you?

42:08.659 --> 42:10.394
It is more
than a little
ironic,

42:10.394 --> 42:12.830
having been
reprimanded
yesterday

42:12.830 --> 42:15.266
by that idiot
Professor Pernet
for poor attendance,

42:15.266 --> 42:17.501
that I should in fact attend
a practical lesson

42:17.501 --> 42:19.336
which was as long
as it was boring,

42:19.336 --> 42:20.971
and utterly pointless,
by the way,

42:20.971 --> 42:23.107
only to be the victim
of an explosion

42:23.107 --> 42:24.508
of my own apparatus.

42:24.508 --> 42:25.509
It was your own fault, then?

42:25.509 --> 42:27.878
Thank you.

42:27.878 --> 42:30.748
And how are you today,
Fraulein Maric?

42:30.748 --> 42:32.149
Extremely well, Herr Einstein.

42:32.149 --> 42:33.284
All the better for seeing

42:33.284 --> 42:35.786
you have escaped the physics
laboratory with your life.

42:35.786 --> 42:40.524
Well, in order not to alarm
you any further, I pledge

42:40.524 --> 42:43.193
to forever continue my studies
here at the Cafe Bahnhof,

42:43.193 --> 42:45.896
reading only the great masters
of theoretical physics

42:45.896 --> 42:48.866
and eschewing the babbling
nonsense of the polytechnicians.

42:48.866 --> 42:50.067
( chuckles )

42:50.067 --> 42:51.669
That's about
all you ever do.

42:51.669 --> 42:56.040
It's getting a little stuffy
in here, Fraulein Maric.

42:56.040 --> 42:59.243
Would you care to take
a walk with me?

42:59.243 --> 43:01.312
There's something
I'd like to discuss with you.

43:01.312 --> 43:04.882
Why, Herr Einstein...

43:04.882 --> 43:06.383
of course.

43:08.886 --> 43:10.487
Perhaps you'd like
me to tell you

43:10.487 --> 43:14.058
what you have missed
in lectures this week?

43:20.130 --> 43:22.700
MAN:
Einstein wasn't exactly
a model student.

43:22.700 --> 43:25.736
He excelled in certain subjects,
especially physics and math,

43:25.736 --> 43:28.439
but he wasn't very diligent
in a lot of his other classes.

43:28.439 --> 43:32.242
He was undoubtedly
very questioning,

43:32.242 --> 43:34.645
which seems to have annoyed
most of his professors

43:34.645 --> 43:35.646
throughout his life.

43:35.646 --> 43:37.381
He would pursue his fascinations

43:37.381 --> 43:39.116
with just incredible
determination.

43:41.952 --> 43:43.754
MAN:
We know from his letters

43:43.754 --> 43:46.056
that Einstein,
even from the age of 16,

43:46.056 --> 43:50.027
was literally obsessed
with the nature of light.

43:54.131 --> 43:56.934
Everyone he could speak to--
his friends, his colleagues,

43:56.934 --> 43:59.903
even his then girlfriend,
Mileva Maric,

43:59.903 --> 44:02.206
who would become his wife--

44:02.206 --> 44:05.676
everyone he badgered with
the question: what is light?

44:07.411 --> 44:10.147
( laughing )

44:13.617 --> 44:17.154
What would I see
if I rode on a beam of light?

44:17.154 --> 44:18.689
What?

44:18.689 --> 44:21.225
A beam of light?

44:21.225 --> 44:24.928
By what method do you propose
to ride on this beam of light?

44:24.928 --> 44:26.997
The method is not important.

44:26.997 --> 44:28.399
Let us just imagine
we two are

44:28.399 --> 44:29.767
( loudly ):
young...

44:29.767 --> 44:30.934
Shh!

44:30.934 --> 44:34.938
( loudly still ):
radical, bohemian experimenters,

44:34.938 --> 44:39.343
hand-in-hand,
on a journey to the outer
reaches of the universe,

44:39.343 --> 44:43.714
and we are riding on
the front of a wave of light.

44:43.714 --> 44:45.082
( laughs )

44:45.082 --> 44:45.983
I really don't know

44:45.983 --> 44:48.052
what you are suggesting,
Herr Einstein.

44:48.052 --> 44:50.387
Do you wish to hold my
hand or ridicule me?

44:50.387 --> 44:51.388
Ridicule you?

44:51.388 --> 44:52.489
No, never.

44:55.759 --> 44:58.162
I merely want you
to help me to understand.

45:00.030 --> 45:01.832
What would we see,
do you think...

45:01.832 --> 45:03.067
Um...

45:03.067 --> 45:09.073
if we were together
and we sped up... and up

45:09.073 --> 45:13.610
until we caught up
to the front of
a beam of light?

45:23.487 --> 45:27.191
LITHGOW:
It was Einstein's relentless
pursuit of light

45:27.191 --> 45:29.993
which would bring about
a revolution in science.

45:31.061 --> 45:33.731
With light he would reinvent
the universe

45:33.731 --> 45:35.966
and find a hidden pathway

45:35.966 --> 45:39.837
that would unite
energy and mass.

45:45.109 --> 45:50.881
Light moves incredibly fast,
670 million miles per hour.

45:50.881 --> 45:53.884
That's why scientists use
the term c.

45:53.884 --> 45:59.123
It stands for celeritas--
Latin for swiftness.

46:11.702 --> 46:14.004
Long before the 19th century,

46:14.004 --> 46:16.740
scientists had computed
the speed of light,

46:16.740 --> 46:21.211
but no one knew
what light actually was.

46:21.211 --> 46:24.915
Back in England, a man we've
already met was willing to make

46:24.915 --> 46:29.253
an educated guess.

46:29.253 --> 46:31.288
After Sir Humphry Davy's death,

46:31.288 --> 46:34.324
Michael Faraday became
Professor Faraday,

46:34.324 --> 46:37.795
one of the most important
experimenters in the world.

46:39.530 --> 46:43.033
The scientific establishment
still found it hard to accept

46:43.033 --> 46:46.203
that electricity and magnetism
were just two aspects

46:46.203 --> 46:47.771
of the same phenomenon,

46:47.771 --> 46:52.276
which Faraday called
electromagnetism.

46:52.276 --> 46:53.544
But now he has

46:53.544 --> 46:58.415
an even more outrageous proposal
for his audience.

47:01.919 --> 47:06.990
Invisible lines
that can emanate

47:06.990 --> 47:09.459
from electricity in a wire,

47:09.459 --> 47:14.598
from a magnet
or... even from the sun.

47:14.598 --> 47:16.667
( crowd laughs )

47:16.667 --> 47:20.237
For it is my contention

47:20.237 --> 47:27.811
that light itself is just one
form of these vibrating lines

47:27.811 --> 47:30.514
of electromagnetism.

47:30.514 --> 47:31.782
( laughter )

47:31.782 --> 47:35.619
LITHGOW:
For 15 years, Faraday struggled
to convince the skeptics

47:35.619 --> 47:38.322
that light was
an electromagnetic wave,

47:38.322 --> 47:42.860
but he lacked the advanced
mathematics to back up his idea.

47:42.860 --> 47:46.263
Eventually, someone came
to his rescue.

47:49.399 --> 47:52.836
Professor James Clerk Maxwell
believed

47:52.836 --> 47:54.972
in Faraday's far-sighted vision,

47:54.972 --> 47:58.375
and he had the mathematical
skill to prove it.

48:05.782 --> 48:10.721
Maxwell and the aging Faraday
became close friends.

48:17.361 --> 48:18.795
James.

48:19.863 --> 48:20.998
James, forgive me.

48:20.998 --> 48:23.267
( gasps )

48:23.267 --> 48:25.669
A word of advice:
don't get old.

48:25.669 --> 48:27.004
( chuckles )

48:27.004 --> 48:28.372
Michael, how are you?

48:28.372 --> 48:29.706
Oh, I'm fine.

48:29.706 --> 48:32.342
Memory isn't too good,
but...

48:32.342 --> 48:34.311
Well, I thought
you might like to see

48:34.311 --> 48:35.545
what I've just published.

48:35.545 --> 48:36.613
Oh, yes, yes.

48:41.485 --> 48:42.519
Splendid.

48:47.057 --> 48:51.662
So your results show that when
electricity flows along a wire,

48:51.662 --> 48:55.265
what it actually does is create
a little bit of magnetism.

48:55.265 --> 48:58.201
Now, as that magnetic
charge moves,

48:58.201 --> 49:00.771
it creates a little piece
of electricity.

49:00.771 --> 49:02.372
Electricity.

49:02.372 --> 49:05.442
Electricity and magnetism
are interwoven,

49:05.442 --> 49:08.078
like a... a never-ending braid.

49:08.078 --> 49:10.180
So it is always pulsing forward.

49:12.482 --> 49:13.550
That's wonderful.

49:15.585 --> 49:16.620
Wonderful.

49:17.621 --> 49:20.123
Michael.

49:20.123 --> 49:23.527
Michael, there's
something very crucial
in maths.

49:23.527 --> 49:25.429
This electricity
producing magnetism

49:25.429 --> 49:27.364
and magnetism
producing electricity--

49:27.364 --> 49:30.067
it can only ever happen
at a very particular speed.

49:30.067 --> 49:32.903
The equations are
very clear about it.

49:32.903 --> 49:36.239
They come up
with just one number:

49:36.239 --> 49:40.410
670 million miles per hour.

49:41.411 --> 49:42.713
I'm not sure I...?

49:42.713 --> 49:45.115
That's the speed of light.

49:45.115 --> 49:47.751
That is the speed of light!

49:47.751 --> 49:50.087
Well, that means you
were right all along.

49:50.087 --> 49:54.024
Light is
an electromagnetic wave.

49:57.461 --> 50:00.998
LITHGOW:
Maxwell had proven Faraday
right.

50:00.998 --> 50:06.837
Electricity and magnetism
are just two aspects

50:06.837 --> 50:11.408
of a deeper unity, a force
now called electromagnetism,

50:11.408 --> 50:15.379
which travels
at 670 million miles per hour.

50:15.379 --> 50:22.352
In its visible form, it is
nothing other than light itself.

50:24.521 --> 50:29.226
And nothing fascinated the young
Einstein more than light.

50:29.226 --> 50:33.430
( playing light romantic piece )

50:47.878 --> 50:49.479
( sighs )

50:49.479 --> 50:51.381
We have lectures
in half an hour.

50:51.381 --> 50:52.649
Oh, let me think.

50:52.649 --> 50:55.118
Professor Weber and his
life-draining monologue

50:55.118 --> 50:57.654
or you... ( kisses )

50:57.654 --> 51:01.725
Mozart and James Clerk Maxwell?

51:01.725 --> 51:02.726
We can't.

51:02.726 --> 51:03.727
We'll get a warning.

51:03.727 --> 51:05.228
Our project
is too precious

51:05.228 --> 51:07.364
to waste time listening
to those dullards.

51:07.364 --> 51:08.532
Come with me,

51:08.532 --> 51:10.467
we'll read Maxwell

51:10.467 --> 51:13.270
and think about
the electromagnetic theory
of light!

51:13.270 --> 51:14.538
( giggling )

51:14.538 --> 51:17.007
Oh, why, my dear
little Johnnie,

51:17.007 --> 51:19.509
how you enchant a lady.

51:42.899 --> 51:44.534
MARIC:
She's very pretty.

51:46.336 --> 51:52.175
Yes, but can she
soar and dance like
our dark souls do?

51:52.175 --> 51:54.444
( sighs )

51:55.779 --> 51:58.915
BODANIS:
Maxwell's equations contained
an incredible prediction.

51:58.915 --> 52:02.052
They said you could never
catch up to a beam of light.

52:02.052 --> 52:05.755
Even if you were traveling
at 670 million miles an hour,

52:05.755 --> 52:08.191
you would still see light
squiggle away from you

52:08.191 --> 52:09.926
at 670 million miles an hour.

52:12.896 --> 52:15.098
Do you see how she stares
at that wave?

52:15.098 --> 52:16.600
Yes.

52:16.600 --> 52:18.201
You see how for her
it is static?

52:18.201 --> 52:19.236
Yes.

52:19.236 --> 52:23.440
She and the wave are traveling
at the same speed.

52:23.440 --> 52:27.310
We see the wave moving
through the water.

52:27.310 --> 52:30.947
But relative to her,
it just sits there.

52:30.947 --> 52:33.250
So is light like that?

52:33.250 --> 52:36.453
Common sense would say that if
you caught up to a light beam,

52:36.453 --> 52:40.390
there would be a wave of light
just sitting there.

52:40.390 --> 52:41.791
Maybe it would be shimmering,

52:41.791 --> 52:43.927
a bit of electricity
and a bit of magnetism.

52:43.927 --> 52:47.664
So if she was traveling
alongside the light wave,

52:47.664 --> 52:48.732
it wouldn't be moving.

52:48.732 --> 52:49.766
It would be static.

52:49.766 --> 52:53.670
But Maxwell says
you can't have static light.

52:53.670 --> 52:55.038
Maybe Maxwell is wrong.

52:55.038 --> 52:56.973
Maybe if you catch up to light,

52:56.973 --> 53:01.511
it is static, Albert,
like a wave next to a boat.

53:03.079 --> 53:07.484
Imagine if I were sitting still
and holding a mirror to my face.

53:07.484 --> 53:12.222
The light travels from my face
to the mirror and I see my face.

53:12.222 --> 53:13.223
Yes.

53:13.223 --> 53:16.693
However, if I and the mirror

53:16.693 --> 53:20.430
were traveling
at the speed of light?

53:20.430 --> 53:23.800
You're going at the same speed
as the light leaving your face?

53:23.800 --> 53:25.468
Exactly.

53:25.468 --> 53:28.338
The light never reaches
the mirror?

53:28.338 --> 53:30.640
So would I be invisible?

53:30.640 --> 53:31.675
Hmm.

53:35.312 --> 53:36.880
That doesn't make sense.

53:39.783 --> 53:42.352
LITHGOW:
Young Einstein was starting
to realize

53:42.352 --> 53:46.089
that light was unlike
any other kind of wave.

53:53.230 --> 53:56.800
Einstein was about to enter
a surreal universe

53:56.800 --> 54:00.003
where energy, mass and
the speed of light intermingled

54:00.003 --> 54:02.572
in a way no one
had ever suspected.

54:03.707 --> 54:06.109
But there was one last
mathematical ingredient

54:06.109 --> 54:07.811
that Einstein would need:

54:07.811 --> 54:11.715
the everyday process
of squaring.

54:22.959 --> 54:25.028
Long before
the French Revolution,

54:25.028 --> 54:28.999
scientists were not sure how
to quantify motion.

54:28.999 --> 54:30.100
Challenge.

54:31.201 --> 54:33.870
LITHGOW:
Equations that explained

54:33.870 --> 54:36.373
how objects moved and collided
were in their infancy.

54:36.373 --> 54:37.374
( growls )

54:37.374 --> 54:39.075
( kisses and giggles )

54:41.945 --> 54:44.214
LITHGOW:
A crucial contribution
to this subject

54:44.214 --> 54:47.017
would come
from an unusual source.

54:51.554 --> 54:54.624
Meet the aristocratic
16-year-old daughter

54:54.624 --> 54:59.296
of one of King Louis XIV's
courtiers, Emilie du Chtelet.

54:59.296 --> 55:01.931
( both grunting )

55:05.635 --> 55:06.770
( groaning )
( giggling )

55:10.040 --> 55:12.075
Quickly, Father
is coming!

55:15.378 --> 55:18.948
LITHGOW:
Emilie du Chtelet would have
a huge effect on physics

55:18.948 --> 55:22.052
in her tragically short
lifetime.

55:22.052 --> 55:24.321
Unheard of for a woman
of her time,

55:24.321 --> 55:26.823
she would publish
many scientific works,

55:26.823 --> 55:30.794
including a translation
of Sir Isaac Newton's Principia,

55:30.794 --> 55:33.730
the greatest treatise on motion
ever written.

55:33.730 --> 55:37.167
Du Chtelet's translation
is still

55:37.167 --> 55:40.937
the standard text in France
today.

55:40.937 --> 55:44.708
Musa, mihi
causas memora...

55:44.708 --> 55:47.043
Muse, my memory causes...

55:47.043 --> 55:49.813
O Muse! The causes
and the crimes relate

55:49.813 --> 55:52.849
What goddess was provoked,
and whence her hate

55:52.849 --> 55:55.151
For what offence
the Queen of Heaven began

55:55.151 --> 55:58.955
To persecute so brave,
so just a man!

55:58.955 --> 56:00.590
Do not be cross
with your sister,

56:00.590 --> 56:02.826
because she persecutes
many a just man!

56:02.826 --> 56:03.827
Only the other night,

56:03.827 --> 56:06.296
Emilie silenced
the duc du Luynes

56:06.296 --> 56:09.833
when she divided a ridiculously
long number in her head

56:09.833 --> 56:10.900
in a matter of seconds.

56:10.900 --> 56:13.303
You should have seen the
incredulity on their faces

56:13.303 --> 56:15.672
when they realized Emilie
was correct.

56:15.672 --> 56:18.608
Was it my sister's
astounding intelligence

56:18.608 --> 56:20.043
or her boundless beauty

56:20.043 --> 56:21.878
that made their mouths gape,
I wonder?

56:21.878 --> 56:24.314
Ah well, yes, you have
a point, monsieur.

56:24.314 --> 56:26.716
Messieurs, I thank you
for your kindness.

56:26.716 --> 56:30.453
I fear, however,
that my wit is only
a curiosity to others.

56:30.453 --> 56:33.390
If only my mind were
permitted opportunity.

56:33.390 --> 56:35.158
My dearest Emilie.

56:35.158 --> 56:37.961
You are blessed
with intellect and courage.

56:37.961 --> 56:41.498
Use them both and the world
will fall at your feet.

56:41.498 --> 56:42.732
No...

56:46.970 --> 56:48.138
WOMAN:
In one sense,

56:48.138 --> 56:51.341
she is a woman utterly out of
her true time and place.

56:51.341 --> 56:53.643
She's a philosopher,
a scientist,

56:53.643 --> 56:56.446
a mathematician,
a linguist.

56:56.446 --> 56:57.680
She demands a freedom

56:57.680 --> 57:00.550
that women didn't begin to enjoy
until over 150 years later--

57:00.550 --> 57:02.685
a freedom to study science,

57:02.685 --> 57:06.289
to write about it,
and to be published.

57:09.225 --> 57:13.863
LITHGOW:
Du Chtelet married a general
in the French army at age 19

57:13.863 --> 57:15.665
and had three children.

57:15.665 --> 57:17.333
She ran a busy household,

57:17.333 --> 57:20.637
all the while pursuing
her passion for science.

57:20.637 --> 57:24.741
She was 23 when she discovered
advanced mathematics.

57:24.741 --> 57:26.676
She enthusiastically
took lessons

57:26.676 --> 57:29.112
from one of the greatest
mathematicians of the day,

57:29.112 --> 57:31.548
Pierre de Maupertuis.

57:31.548 --> 57:33.416
He was an expert on Newton,

57:33.416 --> 57:35.985
and she was his eager
young student;

57:35.985 --> 57:38.121
it seems they had
a brief affair.

57:38.121 --> 57:42.358
But then he set off
on a polar expedition.

57:42.358 --> 57:44.928
Du Chtelet then fell
passionately in love

57:44.928 --> 57:48.598
with Voltaire,
France's greatest poet.

57:48.598 --> 57:51.468
A fierce critic of the king
and the Catholic Church,

57:51.468 --> 57:53.970
Voltaire had been in prison
twice

57:53.970 --> 57:55.472
and exiled to England,

57:55.472 --> 57:59.142
where he became enthralled
by the ideas of Newton.

57:59.142 --> 58:00.210
Back in France,

58:00.210 --> 58:03.713
it wasn't long before he again
insulted the king.

58:03.713 --> 58:08.551
Du Chtelet hid him
in her country home.

58:08.551 --> 58:10.987
The poor little creature
is devoted to him.

58:10.987 --> 58:14.424
LITHGOW:
Isolated far from Paris,
du Chtelet and Voltaire

58:14.424 --> 58:18.561
turned her chateau into a
palace of learning and culture,

58:18.561 --> 58:21.164
complete with
its own tiny theater,

58:21.164 --> 58:25.668
and all with the apparent
blessing of her husband.

58:25.668 --> 58:28.571
FARA:
There's a great deal of myth
surrounding du Chtelet

58:28.571 --> 58:30.406
and her love life

58:30.406 --> 58:32.242
and most of it is
very exaggerated.

58:32.242 --> 58:35.678
But her husband did accept
Voltaire into his household,

58:35.678 --> 58:38.515
and he often went to Paris
on behalf of Voltaire;

58:38.515 --> 58:41.117
he went to his publisher
to plead Voltaire's case

58:41.117 --> 58:43.786
to keep Voltaire out of jail.

58:43.786 --> 58:46.589
And it is also true
that Emilie du Chtelet

58:46.589 --> 58:49.692
did have several affairs
of a fleeting nature.

58:51.794 --> 58:54.264
( audience applauding )

58:54.264 --> 58:55.465
Bravo! Bravo!

58:55.465 --> 58:58.468
ZINSSER:
She created an institution
to rival that

58:58.468 --> 59:01.104
of France's Royal
Academies of Sciences.

59:01.104 --> 59:03.773
Many of the great
philosophers, poets

59:03.773 --> 59:06.276
and scientists of the day
visited.

59:08.711 --> 59:12.715
Ah, monsieur...
you are young.

59:12.715 --> 59:14.517
I hope that soon
you will judge me

59:14.517 --> 59:16.719
for my own merits,
or lack of them,

59:16.719 --> 59:18.821
but do not look upon me

59:18.821 --> 59:20.857
as an appendage
to this great general

59:20.857 --> 59:23.560
or that renowned scholar.

59:23.560 --> 59:25.261
I am in my own right

59:25.261 --> 59:26.563
a whole person,

59:26.563 --> 59:28.364
responsible
to myself alone

59:28.364 --> 59:30.366
for all that I am,

59:30.366 --> 59:32.101
all that I say...

59:32.101 --> 59:33.102
( blows )

59:33.102 --> 59:34.203
all that I do.

59:36.873 --> 59:40.376
LITHGOW:
Du Chtelet learned from
the brilliant men around her,

59:40.376 --> 59:43.012
but she quickly developed
ideas of her own.

59:43.012 --> 59:46.215
Much to the horror
of her mentors,

59:46.215 --> 59:48.952
she even dared to suspect
that there was a flaw

59:48.952 --> 59:53.856
in the great
Sir Isaac Newton's thinking.

59:53.856 --> 59:56.693
Newton stated that
the energy of an object,

59:56.693 --> 01:00:00.163
the force with which it
collided with another object,

01:00:00.163 --> 01:00:01.831
could very simply be
accounted for

01:00:01.831 --> 01:00:05.602
by its mass
times its velocity.

01:00:05.602 --> 01:00:08.404
In correspondence
with scientists in Germany,

01:00:08.404 --> 01:00:10.807
du Chtelet learned
of another view,

01:00:10.807 --> 01:00:13.743
that of Gottfried Leibniz.

01:00:13.743 --> 01:00:17.714
He proposed that moving objects
had a kind of inner spirit.

01:00:17.714 --> 01:00:21.851
He called it Vis Viva,
Latin for living force.

01:00:21.851 --> 01:00:25.655
Many discounted his ideas,
but Leibniz was convinced

01:00:25.655 --> 01:00:28.257
that the energy of an object
was made up

01:00:28.257 --> 01:00:32.395
of its mass
times its velocity squared.

01:00:35.431 --> 01:00:37.834
Taking the square of something
is an ancient procedure.

01:00:37.834 --> 01:00:39.268
If you say a garden is
four square,

01:00:39.268 --> 01:00:41.270
you mean that it might be
built up

01:00:41.270 --> 01:00:44.140
by four slabs along one edge
and four along the other.

01:00:44.140 --> 01:00:46.075
So the total number of
paving slabs is

01:00:46.075 --> 01:00:47.944
four times four: 16.

01:00:47.944 --> 01:00:50.179
If the garden is eight square--
eight by eight--

01:00:50.179 --> 01:00:51.881
well, eight squared is 64.

01:00:51.881 --> 01:00:53.616
It'll have 64 slabs in it.

01:00:53.616 --> 01:00:56.319
This huge multiplication,
this building up by squares,

01:00:56.319 --> 01:00:58.621
is something you find in nature
all the time.

01:00:59.589 --> 01:01:01.791
Emilie?

01:01:01.791 --> 01:01:03.726
Emilie, you are
being absurd!

01:01:03.726 --> 01:01:05.762
Why ascribe
to an object

01:01:05.762 --> 01:01:09.832
a vague and
immeasurable force
like Vis Viva?

01:01:09.832 --> 01:01:11.300
It is a return
to the old ways!

01:01:14.637 --> 01:01:16.606
It is the occult!

01:01:18.775 --> 01:01:20.610
When movement commences,

01:01:20.610 --> 01:01:22.378
you say it is true
that a force is produced

01:01:22.378 --> 01:01:24.347
which did not exist until now.

01:01:24.347 --> 01:01:26.349
Think of our bodies--
to have free will

01:01:26.349 --> 01:01:28.384
we must be free
to initiate motion.

01:01:28.384 --> 01:01:29.986
So all Leibniz is asking is,

01:01:29.986 --> 01:01:31.487
where does all
this force come from?

01:01:31.487 --> 01:01:32.522
In your case, my dear,

01:01:32.522 --> 01:01:34.590
the force, I am sure,
is primeval.

01:01:34.590 --> 01:01:36.859
Oh! You're infuriating!

01:01:36.859 --> 01:01:38.695
You hide behind wit and sarcasm.

01:01:38.695 --> 01:01:41.264
You only think
you understand Newton.

01:01:41.264 --> 01:01:43.700
You are incapable
of understanding
Leibniz.

01:01:43.700 --> 01:01:45.301
You are a provocateur.

01:01:45.301 --> 01:01:47.303
Everything you do is
about something else

01:01:47.303 --> 01:01:48.838
and makes trouble
for you.

01:01:48.838 --> 01:01:51.040
Criticize this,
denounce that.

01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:53.443
Are you capable of discovering
something of your own?

01:01:58.848 --> 01:02:00.883
I discovered you!

01:02:06.923 --> 01:02:09.492
LITHGOW:
Despite the overwhelming support
for Newton,

01:02:09.492 --> 01:02:13.096
du Chtelet did not waver
in her belief.

01:02:21.237 --> 01:02:23.906
Eventually, she came across
an experiment

01:02:23.906 --> 01:02:27.343
performed by a Dutch scientist,
Willem 's Gravesande,

01:02:27.343 --> 01:02:29.479
that would prove her point.

01:02:30.613 --> 01:02:33.316
'S Gravesande in Leiden
has been dropping lead balls

01:02:33.316 --> 01:02:34.917
into a pan of clay.

01:02:34.917 --> 01:02:38.855
( sarcastically ):
Dropping lead balls into clay!

01:02:38.855 --> 01:02:40.890
How very
imaginative.

01:02:40.890 --> 01:02:43.960
DU CHATELET:
Using Newton's formulas,
Monsieur Voltaire,

01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:46.763
he then drops a second ball
from a higher height,

01:02:46.763 --> 01:02:49.098
calculated to exactly
double the speed

01:02:49.098 --> 01:02:51.367
of the first ball on impact.

01:02:51.367 --> 01:02:54.904
So, messieurs, care
for a little wager?

01:02:56.506 --> 01:03:00.109
Newton tells us that by doubling
the speed of the ball,

01:03:00.109 --> 01:03:02.512
we will double the distance
it travels

01:03:02.512 --> 01:03:03.679
into the clay.

01:03:03.679 --> 01:03:06.749
Leibniz asks us
to square that speed.

01:03:06.749 --> 01:03:09.919
If he is correct,
the ball will travel not two,

01:03:09.919 --> 01:03:11.954
but four times as far.

01:03:11.954 --> 01:03:14.090
So who is correct?

01:03:15.057 --> 01:03:16.058
Messieurs,

01:03:16.058 --> 01:03:19.629
I feel Mr. Newton's
reputation dwindling

01:03:19.629 --> 01:03:20.463
ever so
slightly.

01:03:20.463 --> 01:03:21.564
Oh,
Maupertuis!

01:03:21.564 --> 01:03:23.099
Do not succumb to her!

01:03:23.099 --> 01:03:24.333
There is no
earthly reason

01:03:24.333 --> 01:03:25.802
to ascribe
hidden forces

01:03:25.802 --> 01:03:28.805
to this Dutchman's
lead balls!

01:03:28.805 --> 01:03:30.373
( men laughing )

01:03:31.808 --> 01:03:32.909
Well...

01:03:32.909 --> 01:03:38.114
the ball travels
four times further.

01:03:40.483 --> 01:03:42.819
Turns out Leibniz is
the one who is right--

01:03:42.819 --> 01:03:45.855
it's the best way to express
the energy of a moving object.

01:03:45.855 --> 01:03:48.191
If you drive a car
at 20 miles an hour,

01:03:48.191 --> 01:03:50.693
it takes a certain distance to
stop if you slam on the brakes.

01:03:50.693 --> 01:03:52.261
If you're going three times
as fast--

01:03:52.261 --> 01:03:53.462
you're going 60 miles an hour--

01:03:53.462 --> 01:03:55.331
it won't take you three times
as long to stop,

01:03:55.331 --> 01:03:58.467
it'll take you
nine times as long to stop.

01:03:58.467 --> 01:04:02.171
Oh. Well... it does seem

01:04:02.171 --> 01:04:04.841
worth consideration.

01:04:04.841 --> 01:04:07.677
Perhaps we might look over
his calculations?

01:04:07.677 --> 01:04:09.879
I have already checked
his figures.

01:04:09.879 --> 01:04:12.181
I am sure Leibniz is correct
on this point.

01:04:12.181 --> 01:04:13.583
I intend
to include

01:04:13.583 --> 01:04:15.418
a section on this matter
in my book.

01:04:16.185 --> 01:04:17.987
MAUPERTUIS:
Really?

01:04:17.987 --> 01:04:20.890
Do be careful, madame.

01:04:20.890 --> 01:04:24.293
Do you think the Academy
is ready for such an opinion?

01:04:24.293 --> 01:04:25.294
Quite, quite.

01:04:25.294 --> 01:04:26.462
We really should be
careful.

01:04:26.462 --> 01:04:28.531
We?

01:04:28.531 --> 01:04:31.167
I see no reason to delay.

01:04:31.167 --> 01:04:34.470
There is no right time
for the truth.

01:04:36.772 --> 01:04:38.808
ZINSSER:
Emilie du Chtelet published

01:04:38.808 --> 01:04:40.843
her Institutions of Physics
in 1740,

01:04:40.843 --> 01:04:44.313
and it provoked
great controversy.

01:04:47.884 --> 01:04:50.319
Voltaire wrote

01:04:50.319 --> 01:04:55.091
that She was a great man whose
only fault was being a woman.

01:04:55.091 --> 01:04:58.461
In her day,
that was a great compliment.

01:05:13.242 --> 01:05:15.978
I am with child.

01:05:21.117 --> 01:05:23.119
You are sure?

01:05:23.119 --> 01:05:24.253
Undoubtedly.

01:05:24.253 --> 01:05:26.289
Two to three
months.

01:05:27.990 --> 01:05:29.325
I'm afraid that...

01:05:29.325 --> 01:05:30.826
You are afraid?

01:05:30.826 --> 01:05:32.828
You should have...

01:05:41.437 --> 01:05:43.239
Well, this child is
obviously not mine.

01:05:46.108 --> 01:05:49.245
Nor is it your husband's.

01:05:52.715 --> 01:05:53.916
( sighs )

01:05:53.916 --> 01:05:55.051
Oh, Emilie.

01:05:55.051 --> 01:05:56.052
Emilie.

01:06:00.356 --> 01:06:02.358
Emilie du Chtelet knew
that in the 18th century

01:06:02.358 --> 01:06:04.493
for a woman to become pregnant
at the age of 43

01:06:04.493 --> 01:06:06.062
was really very dangerous,

01:06:06.062 --> 01:06:07.630
and all the while
she was pregnant

01:06:07.630 --> 01:06:11.067
she had terrible premonitions
about what was going to happen.

01:06:13.436 --> 01:06:16.605
LITHGOW:
All her life, du Chtelet
had tried to rise above

01:06:16.605 --> 01:06:18.741
the limitations
placed on her gender.

01:06:18.741 --> 01:06:22.545
In the end, it was an affair
with a young soldier

01:06:22.545 --> 01:06:24.947
that led to her demise.

01:06:24.947 --> 01:06:27.883
Six days after giving birth
to her fourth child,

01:06:27.883 --> 01:06:30.586
she suffered an embolism
and died.

01:06:36.659 --> 01:06:38.928
Emilie du Chtelet's
conviction

01:06:38.928 --> 01:06:40.763
that the energy of an object

01:06:40.763 --> 01:06:43.366
is a function
of the square of its speed

01:06:43.366 --> 01:06:46.202
sparked a fierce debate.

01:06:46.202 --> 01:06:47.303
After her death,

01:06:47.303 --> 01:06:50.539
it took a hundred years
for the idea to be accepted--

01:06:50.539 --> 01:06:55.544
just in time for Einstein
to use this brilliant insight

01:06:55.544 --> 01:07:00.116
to finally bring energy
and mass together with light.

01:07:08.758 --> 01:07:13.929
Einstein pursued light right
through university and beyond.

01:07:13.929 --> 01:07:16.866
Unfortunately, he'd upset
so many professors

01:07:16.866 --> 01:07:19.535
that no one would write him
a reference.

01:07:19.535 --> 01:07:24.940
He accepted a low-paying job
in the Swiss patent office.

01:07:24.940 --> 01:07:27.443
He and Mileva married
and had a child.

01:07:27.443 --> 01:07:29.845
The young family struggled.

01:07:29.845 --> 01:07:33.682
But none of it seems
to bother Albert.

01:07:33.682 --> 01:07:35.317
Einstein?

01:07:35.317 --> 01:07:37.119
I see you are busy,

01:07:37.119 --> 01:07:39.055
as usual.

01:07:39.055 --> 01:07:41.223
Look, Einstein...

01:07:41.223 --> 01:07:43.893
Albert.

01:07:43.893 --> 01:07:48.297
You have shown
some quite good
achievements.

01:07:48.297 --> 01:07:50.499
But, listen...

01:07:50.499 --> 01:07:52.968
About your promotion.

01:07:52.968 --> 01:07:54.637
I really think it would be
better to wait

01:07:54.637 --> 01:07:56.472
until you have
become more fully familiar

01:07:56.472 --> 01:07:58.874
with mechanical
engineering.

01:07:58.874 --> 01:08:00.776
I'm sorry.

01:08:00.776 --> 01:08:04.180
Perhaps
next time, hmm?

01:08:08.551 --> 01:08:09.985
MILEVA:
But I wanted to hire a maid

01:08:09.985 --> 01:08:12.688
so I can get back
and finish my degree.

01:08:12.688 --> 01:08:14.824
Now I will never pass
my dissertation.

01:08:14.824 --> 01:08:17.126
Oh, come, come,
my pretty little duck.

01:08:17.126 --> 01:08:19.562
All will be fine, you'll see.

01:08:19.562 --> 01:08:21.363
But how will it be fine,
Albert?!

01:08:21.363 --> 01:08:22.898
Do I have to just wait
another year

01:08:22.898 --> 01:08:25.401
until you are promoted?

01:08:25.401 --> 01:08:26.402
( baby crying )

01:08:26.402 --> 01:08:27.403
Come on.

01:08:27.403 --> 01:08:29.338
Come on, my little one.

01:08:29.338 --> 01:08:30.473
Oh, there we are.

01:08:30.473 --> 01:08:36.278
( baby continues crying )

01:08:37.913 --> 01:08:40.950
All will be fine.

01:08:40.950 --> 01:08:43.185
All will be fine, you'll see.

01:08:46.255 --> 01:08:47.556
There really is a very charming,

01:08:47.556 --> 01:08:50.159
but kind of a self-centered
streak to Einstein.

01:08:50.159 --> 01:08:52.061
He focuses only on
his particular obsessions.

01:08:52.061 --> 01:08:54.663
If the rest of the world fits in
around him, that's fine,

01:08:54.663 --> 01:08:57.399
if they can't,
it doesn't bother him.

01:09:10.112 --> 01:09:11.413
( no voice )

01:09:42.011 --> 01:09:44.313
Albert, Albert, Albert.

01:09:44.313 --> 01:09:46.348
A pretty neck
and your head spins.

01:09:46.348 --> 01:09:50.419
Besso, we must behold and
comprehend the mysterious.

01:09:50.419 --> 01:09:53.989
Well, that kind of mysterious is
going to get you into trouble.

01:09:53.989 --> 01:09:55.591
I'll tell you what is
truly mysterious:

01:09:55.591 --> 01:09:57.860
the secret of a long
and happy marriage.

01:10:00.029 --> 01:10:03.199
The mathematics are fine,
if a little unconventional,

01:10:03.199 --> 01:10:05.634
but this only works
for big systems.

01:10:05.634 --> 01:10:07.603
It'll fall down when
you apply it to small systems.

01:10:07.603 --> 01:10:09.438
I disagree.

01:10:09.438 --> 01:10:10.139
BESSO:
Oh, no.

01:10:10.139 --> 01:10:11.140
Here we go--

01:10:11.140 --> 01:10:13.175
another grand theory
by Herr Albert Einstein,

01:10:13.175 --> 01:10:14.176
Patent Clerk,

01:10:14.176 --> 01:10:15.644
Third Class.

01:10:15.644 --> 01:10:19.081
What would happen
if one applied those formulae

01:10:19.081 --> 01:10:20.382
to electromagnetic radiation?

01:10:20.382 --> 01:10:21.483
Albert,

01:10:21.483 --> 01:10:24.086
you can't just take one bit
of physics and apply it

01:10:24.086 --> 01:10:26.889
without proper regard
to a completely different area.

01:10:26.889 --> 01:10:29.358
Why not?

01:10:29.358 --> 01:10:30.392
Albert.

01:10:30.392 --> 01:10:33.262
I know you like
the grand linkages,

01:10:33.262 --> 01:10:34.530
the big theories,

01:10:34.530 --> 01:10:36.899
but wouldn't things
be better all round

01:10:36.899 --> 01:10:39.635
if you just got going
in some small area?

01:10:39.635 --> 01:10:40.836
Got a university post.

01:10:40.836 --> 01:10:43.539
Get a decent wage,
for God's sake.

01:10:43.539 --> 01:10:45.007
At least Mileva
could study again.

01:10:45.007 --> 01:10:47.009
Then she'd be happy,
and you'd be happy.

01:10:47.009 --> 01:10:52.381
Ah, the vulgar struggle
for survival: food and sex.

01:10:52.381 --> 01:10:55.017
Spoken like
a true bourgeois.

01:10:55.017 --> 01:11:00.956
Besso, I want to know
how God created this world.

01:11:00.956 --> 01:11:04.360
I am not interested
in this or that phenomenon,

01:11:04.360 --> 01:11:07.129
in the spectrum of this
or that element.

01:11:07.129 --> 01:11:09.265
I want to know His thoughts.

01:11:09.265 --> 01:11:13.369
The rest... they're details.

01:11:13.369 --> 01:11:14.937
Yes, but you can't
feed your children

01:11:14.937 --> 01:11:17.072
on His thoughts, Bertie.

01:11:28.350 --> 01:11:30.719
KAISER:
So it turns out,
Einstein was going for a walk

01:11:30.719 --> 01:11:32.421
with his very close friend,
Michele Besso.

01:11:32.421 --> 01:11:33.856
They'd studied physics together

01:11:33.856 --> 01:11:36.258
and talked about physics and
philosophy for years and years.

01:11:36.258 --> 01:11:38.193
They were very close.

01:11:38.193 --> 01:11:39.928
They had cornered
the question of light

01:11:39.928 --> 01:11:41.130
from every possible angle.

01:11:45.601 --> 01:11:48.137
See these clocks are over here?

01:11:48.137 --> 01:11:50.039
LITHGOW:
As Einstein and Besso
were ruminating

01:11:50.039 --> 01:11:52.107
on how much time it would take
light to reach them

01:11:52.107 --> 01:11:55.044
from clocks at different
distances,

01:11:55.044 --> 01:11:59.048
Einstein had a monumental
insight.

01:12:00.349 --> 01:12:03.819
( church bell tolling )

01:12:03.819 --> 01:12:06.188
( exhales deeply )

01:12:06.188 --> 01:12:08.524
Thank you.

01:12:08.524 --> 01:12:11.794
Thank you.

01:12:11.794 --> 01:12:16.131
I have completely solved
the problem.

01:12:18.567 --> 01:12:20.903
Albert!

01:12:24.306 --> 01:12:29.044
BODANIS:
What Einstein did was completely
turn the problem on its head.

01:12:29.044 --> 01:12:31.180
Other scientists
had found it impossible

01:12:31.180 --> 01:12:32.581
to accept Maxwell's idea--

01:12:32.581 --> 01:12:34.850
that light would always move
away from you

01:12:34.850 --> 01:12:36.485
at 670 million miles an hour,

01:12:36.485 --> 01:12:38.921
even if you, too, were traveling
really fast.

01:12:38.921 --> 01:12:42.024
But Einstein just accepted that
as a fact:

01:12:42.024 --> 01:12:44.493
light's speed
never ever changes.

01:12:44.493 --> 01:12:45.861
Then what he did was bend

01:12:45.861 --> 01:12:47.830
everything we know
about the universe

01:12:47.830 --> 01:12:49.365
to fit light's fixed speed.

01:12:50.833 --> 01:12:53.702
What he discovered
was that to do that

01:12:53.702 --> 01:12:55.871
you have to slow down time.

01:12:57.239 --> 01:12:59.942
His extraordinary insight
is that time...

01:12:59.942 --> 01:13:02.277
as you approach
the speed of light,

01:13:02.277 --> 01:13:04.847
time itself will slow down.

01:13:04.847 --> 01:13:07.750
It's a monumental shift
in how we see the world.

01:13:12.721 --> 01:13:15.023
The instant, the very instant

01:13:15.023 --> 01:13:18.127
when Einstein had
this brilliant insight

01:13:18.127 --> 01:13:20.195
that time could slow down,

01:13:20.195 --> 01:13:22.765
well, the floodgates
began to open.

01:13:22.765 --> 01:13:26.301
( clocks ticking )

01:13:26.301 --> 01:13:29.638
You see,
before then people had assumed

01:13:29.638 --> 01:13:33.542
that time was like a wristwatch
on God's hand,

01:13:33.542 --> 01:13:36.845
that it beat at a steady rate
throughout the universe,

01:13:36.845 --> 01:13:38.247
no matter were you were.

01:13:38.247 --> 01:13:39.715
( clock's ticking slowing )

01:13:39.715 --> 01:13:41.016
Einstein said no--

01:13:41.016 --> 01:13:44.319
that the tick, tick, tick
of this wristwatch

01:13:44.319 --> 01:13:46.722
was actually
the click, click, click

01:13:46.722 --> 01:13:49.191
of electricity turning
into magnetism

01:13:49.191 --> 01:13:50.659
turning into electricity.

01:13:50.659 --> 01:13:53.929
In other words,
the steady pace of light itself.

01:14:04.173 --> 01:14:08.310
BODANIS:
1905 was a miraculous year
for Einstein and for physics.

01:14:10.679 --> 01:14:13.582
He had an unbelievable
outpouring of creativity.

01:14:13.582 --> 01:14:16.318
It starts with his publication
of a paper

01:14:16.318 --> 01:14:19.188
on how to work out
the true size of atoms.

01:14:19.188 --> 01:14:20.322
Two months later

01:14:20.322 --> 01:14:23.091
is the publication of his paper
on the nature of light--

01:14:23.091 --> 01:14:25.194
that's what will earn him
the Nobel Prize.

01:14:25.194 --> 01:14:27.229
The third paper,
only a month later,

01:14:27.229 --> 01:14:29.331
is on how molecules move
when heated,

01:14:29.331 --> 01:14:33.001
and that finally ends the debate
on whether atoms really exist.

01:14:33.001 --> 01:14:34.670
The fourth paper is published

01:14:34.670 --> 01:14:36.672
at the end
of this half-year period.

01:14:36.672 --> 01:14:38.006
In it Einstein sets out

01:14:38.006 --> 01:14:40.042
his theory of light,
time and space.

01:14:40.042 --> 01:14:42.044
It was the Theory
of Special Relativity.

01:14:42.044 --> 01:14:46.215
That changed the way
we see the world.

01:14:46.215 --> 01:14:49.685
LITHGOW:
In Einstein's new world,

01:14:49.685 --> 01:14:56.191
the one true constant was not
time or even space, but light.

01:14:58.494 --> 01:15:02.164
( steam whistle blowing,
train chugging )

01:15:03.799 --> 01:15:08.337
But Einstein's miracle year
was not over.

01:15:08.337 --> 01:15:10.873
( steam hissing, fire roaring )

01:15:13.308 --> 01:15:17.479
In one last great 1905 paper,

01:15:17.479 --> 01:15:20.782
he would propose
an even deeper unity.

01:15:20.782 --> 01:15:22.384
( steam whistle blowing )

01:15:22.384 --> 01:15:24.386
As he computed

01:15:24.386 --> 01:15:27.456
all the implications
of his new theory,

01:15:27.456 --> 01:15:30.659
he noticed
another strange connection,

01:15:30.659 --> 01:15:35.097
this one between energy,
mass and light.

01:15:43.705 --> 01:15:45.807
( train whistle blowing )

01:15:49.177 --> 01:15:51.213
Einstein realizes
that the speed of light

01:15:51.213 --> 01:15:53.115
is kind of like
a cosmic speed limit.

01:15:53.115 --> 01:15:56.451
Nothing can go faster.

01:15:57.886 --> 01:16:00.122
So imagine we have a train
charging along,

01:16:00.122 --> 01:16:02.858
and let's say it's getting
up to the speed of light

01:16:02.858 --> 01:16:05.794
and we're stuffing
more and more energy in,

01:16:05.794 --> 01:16:08.230
trying to get it to go
faster and faster.

01:16:08.230 --> 01:16:11.700
But it's still bumping up
against the speed of light.

01:16:11.700 --> 01:16:13.468
So all this energy,
where does it go?

01:16:13.468 --> 01:16:15.370
It has to go somewhere.

01:16:15.370 --> 01:16:17.639
Amazingly, it goes
into the object's mass.

01:16:19.041 --> 01:16:22.444
From our point of view,
the train actually gets heavier;

01:16:22.444 --> 01:16:24.613
the energy becomes mass.

01:16:34.222 --> 01:16:36.325
It's an incredible idea.

01:16:36.325 --> 01:16:39.027
Even Einstein is amazed by it.

01:16:42.764 --> 01:16:45.534
I think I have
found a connection

01:16:45.534 --> 01:16:47.736
between energy and mass.

01:16:47.736 --> 01:16:52.507
If I am right, then energy
and mass are not absolute.

01:16:52.507 --> 01:16:54.710
They are not distinct--

01:16:54.710 --> 01:16:58.213
they can be converted
into one another.

01:16:58.213 --> 01:17:02.784
Energy can become mass,
and mass can become energy.

01:17:02.784 --> 01:17:06.455
And not just energy
equaling mass.

01:17:06.455 --> 01:17:12.661
Energy equals mass times the
square of the speed of light.

01:17:12.661 --> 01:17:14.930
( cackles; laughs softly )

01:17:14.930 --> 01:17:18.100
Would you like me to check
your mathematics?

01:17:25.073 --> 01:17:31.546
LITHGOW:
Einstein sent his fifth great
1905 paper for publication.

01:17:31.546 --> 01:17:36.151
In three pages he simply stated
that energy and mass

01:17:36.151 --> 01:17:40.789
were connected by the square
of the speed of light--

01:17:40.789 --> 01:17:44.626
E equals m c-squared.

01:17:50.699 --> 01:17:54.903
With four familiar notes
in the scale of nature,

01:17:54.903 --> 01:18:01.276
this patent officer had composed
a totally fresh melody--

01:18:01.276 --> 01:18:06.214
the culmination of his ten-year
journey into light.

01:18:08.984 --> 01:18:10.819
Here we are
for thousands of years

01:18:10.819 --> 01:18:14.022
thinking that over here is
a world of objects, of matter,

01:18:14.022 --> 01:18:16.591
and over there is
an entirely separate world

01:18:16.591 --> 01:18:18.560
of movement,
of forces, of energy.

01:18:18.560 --> 01:18:21.263
And Einstein says,
No, they are not separate.

01:18:21.263 --> 01:18:22.798
Energy can become mass,

01:18:22.798 --> 01:18:25.600
and crucially,
mass can also become energy.

01:18:25.600 --> 01:18:29.738
There is a deep unity between
energy, matter and light.

01:18:32.741 --> 01:18:34.776
KAKU:
E equals m c-squared.

01:18:34.776 --> 01:18:38.947
That equation shows that every
piece of matter in our universe

01:18:38.947 --> 01:18:43.218
has stored within it
a fantastic amount of energy.

01:18:43.218 --> 01:18:45.220
The speed of light, for example,

01:18:45.220 --> 01:18:47.656
is about 300 million meters
per second.

01:18:47.656 --> 01:18:51.860
You multiply that by itself
and you get 90 quadrillion.

01:18:51.860 --> 01:18:54.329
So in other words,
what is matter?

01:18:54.329 --> 01:18:58.200
In some sense, matter is nothing
but the condensation

01:18:58.200 --> 01:19:00.168
of vast amounts of energy.

01:19:00.168 --> 01:19:02.270
So in other words,
if you could unlock...

01:19:02.270 --> 01:19:06.641
somehow unlock all the energy
stored within my pen,

01:19:06.641 --> 01:19:11.379
that would erupt with a force
comparable to an atomic bomb.

01:19:23.024 --> 01:19:25.527
After Einstein's fifth
great 1905 paper,

01:19:25.527 --> 01:19:29.331
physicists no longer spoke
of mass or energy--

01:19:29.331 --> 01:19:31.433
they are now
the same thing to us.

01:19:31.433 --> 01:19:32.501
( steam hissing )

01:19:46.948 --> 01:19:52.220
LITHGOW:
Probably the most miraculous
year in science ends in silence.

01:19:55.023 --> 01:20:00.662
The articles are published
to resounding... nothing.

01:20:00.662 --> 01:20:03.365
EINSTEIN ( voice echoing ):
I think the Gods

01:20:03.365 --> 01:20:04.599
are laughing at me.

01:20:06.668 --> 01:20:10.772
LITHGOW:
Then slowly it starts.

01:20:10.772 --> 01:20:13.408
A letter here, a letter there.

01:20:13.408 --> 01:20:17.779
For four years Einstein answered
each inquiry dutifully,

01:20:17.779 --> 01:20:21.216
trying to explain
his difficult, complex ideas

01:20:21.216 --> 01:20:24.019
to a confused physics community.

01:20:26.621 --> 01:20:30.592
GATES:
I love the idea that life
just went on as normal.

01:20:30.592 --> 01:20:35.664
Here are these universe-changing
papers circling around,

01:20:35.664 --> 01:20:38.733
and the world is... struggling
to come to terms with them.

01:20:42.671 --> 01:20:44.806
KAKU:
Einstein had a fan club

01:20:44.806 --> 01:20:46.575
of just one.

01:20:46.575 --> 01:20:51.012
Luckily it happened to be the
most important living physicist.

01:20:51.012 --> 01:20:53.548
SUPERVISOR:
Einstein.

01:20:53.548 --> 01:20:55.684
Einstein.

01:20:55.684 --> 01:20:58.887
Max Planck has sent
someone to see you.

01:20:58.887 --> 01:20:59.888
Max Planck?

01:20:59.888 --> 01:21:00.889
Yes.

01:21:00.889 --> 01:21:02.691
He has sent
his assistant.

01:21:02.691 --> 01:21:04.659
He's here to see you.

01:21:10.699 --> 01:21:15.170
LITHGOW:
Max Planck encourages the
world's most eminent physicists

01:21:15.170 --> 01:21:17.105
to take Einstein seriously.

01:21:18.206 --> 01:21:20.342
After four years of waiting,

01:21:20.342 --> 01:21:24.946
he is appointed professor of
physics at Zurich University.

01:21:26.548 --> 01:21:29.851
From there his career
is meteoric.

01:21:29.851 --> 01:21:33.989
He is made
professor of physics in Berlin,

01:21:33.989 --> 01:21:39.027
achieves world renown
and becomes a household name.

01:21:39.027 --> 01:21:44.299
He is the undisputed father
of modern physics.

01:21:59.180 --> 01:22:03.919
But Einstein's success was
the downfall of his marriage.

01:22:07.188 --> 01:22:11.960
In 1919 he divorced Mileva
and married his cousin.

01:22:17.365 --> 01:22:19.334
His fame led to
numerous affairs.

01:22:55.503 --> 01:22:59.941
E equals m c-squared became
the Holy Grail of science.

01:22:59.941 --> 01:23:04.079
It held out the promise
of vast reserves of energy

01:23:04.079 --> 01:23:06.448
locked deep inside the atom.

01:23:06.448 --> 01:23:07.949
Einstein suspected

01:23:07.949 --> 01:23:10.819
that it would take a hundred
years of research to unlock it.

01:23:10.819 --> 01:23:14.255
But he hadn't banked on
the Second World War

01:23:14.255 --> 01:23:18.493
and the genius of a Jewish woman
in Hitler's Germany.

01:23:39.481 --> 01:23:45.387
28-year-old Austrian
Lise Meitner was painfully shy.

01:23:45.387 --> 01:23:46.955
Despite her anxiety,

01:23:46.955 --> 01:23:50.492
the young doctor of physics
arrived in Berlin

01:23:50.492 --> 01:23:52.794
determined to pursue a career

01:23:52.794 --> 01:23:56.164
in the exciting new field
of radioactivity.

01:23:56.164 --> 01:23:58.066
Unfortunately, in 1907,

01:23:58.066 --> 01:24:02.370
German universities did not
employ female graduates.

01:24:07.642 --> 01:24:12.147
Luckily,
one man came to her aid.

01:24:13.948 --> 01:24:15.950
Fraulein Meitner?

01:24:15.950 --> 01:24:17.452
Yes?

01:24:17.452 --> 01:24:20.355
Otto Hahn. I'm a researcher
in the Chemistry Institute.

01:24:20.355 --> 01:24:21.856
Professor Planck
suggested I...

01:24:21.856 --> 01:24:25.527
Herr Hahn, I have read
your papers on thorium
and on mesothorium,

01:24:25.527 --> 01:24:26.961
and Dr. Planck
suggested that I...

01:24:26.961 --> 01:24:28.696
Yes, he suggested
that I speak with you.

01:24:28.696 --> 01:24:30.031
I need someone
to collaborate...

01:24:30.031 --> 01:24:32.700
I think I could really help
with the physical analysis.

01:24:32.700 --> 01:24:34.169
And the mathematics?

01:24:35.170 --> 01:24:37.639
Yes, yes--
and the mathematics.

01:24:37.639 --> 01:24:38.840
Studying radioactive atoms

01:24:38.840 --> 01:24:40.375
has become
so much a collaboration

01:24:40.375 --> 01:24:42.243
between chemistry
and physics these days.

01:24:42.243 --> 01:24:44.479
Yes, yes.

01:24:44.479 --> 01:24:46.714
I'll ask Fischer
for a laboratory, then.

01:24:46.714 --> 01:24:48.650
Excellent.

01:24:49.951 --> 01:24:51.453
I'll speak to you soon.

01:24:52.787 --> 01:24:56.458
LITHGOW:
Lise Meitner had just taken
the first step on a journey

01:24:56.458 --> 01:24:59.427
that would irrevocably change
world history.

01:24:59.427 --> 01:25:03.264
For her it would be a road
marked with success and renown,

01:25:03.264 --> 01:25:07.268
but also with terror
and betrayal.

01:25:12.540 --> 01:25:15.810
BODANIS:
At this time, not a lot
was known about the atom.

01:25:17.412 --> 01:25:18.613
At first, people thought

01:25:18.613 --> 01:25:20.548
it was like
a miniature solar system;

01:25:20.548 --> 01:25:22.851
there's a solid nucleus
of the center

01:25:22.851 --> 01:25:25.019
and electrons would spin
around it,

01:25:25.019 --> 01:25:27.288
sort of like planets
around our sun.

01:25:27.288 --> 01:25:29.390
A little later, some researchers
proposed

01:25:29.390 --> 01:25:31.993
that the nucleus itself
wasn't a solid chunk

01:25:31.993 --> 01:25:33.761
but was made up
of separate particles,

01:25:33.761 --> 01:25:34.963
of protons and neutrons.

01:25:34.963 --> 01:25:38.099
But then-- in what are called
radioactive metals,

01:25:38.099 --> 01:25:40.201
things like radium and uranium--

01:25:40.201 --> 01:25:42.837
the nucleus itself
seemed to be unstable,

01:25:42.837 --> 01:25:44.973
leaking out energy
and particles.

01:25:44.973 --> 01:25:48.109
Perhaps this was an example
of E equals m c-squared--

01:25:48.109 --> 01:25:50.712
the mass of a nucleus
turning into energy.

01:25:55.150 --> 01:25:58.119
LITHGOW:
Meitner and Hahn's collaboration

01:25:58.119 --> 01:26:01.422
to unlock the secrets
of the atom started out

01:26:01.422 --> 01:26:03.625
on an extremely unequal footing.

01:26:03.625 --> 01:26:06.161
He was given a laboratory.

01:26:06.161 --> 01:26:08.763
She was forced to work
in a wood shop.

01:26:08.763 --> 01:26:10.999
I see you haven't set
your hair on fire.

01:26:12.300 --> 01:26:13.968
Herr Hahn?

01:26:13.968 --> 01:26:15.870
The boss-- he thinks
that if he lets women

01:26:15.870 --> 01:26:17.172
into the Chemistry Institute

01:26:17.172 --> 01:26:18.806
they'll set
their hair on fire.

01:26:18.806 --> 01:26:21.609
Oh... so his beard
must be fireproof.

01:26:22.677 --> 01:26:24.412
( footsteps approaching )

01:26:26.014 --> 01:26:27.248
Good day, Herr Hahn.

01:26:27.248 --> 01:26:29.284
Good day.

01:26:32.320 --> 01:26:33.821
You see?

01:26:33.821 --> 01:26:35.924
I am nonexistent

01:26:35.924 --> 01:26:37.659
to this place.

01:26:37.659 --> 01:26:41.462
At least physicists recognize me
for my abilities.

01:26:41.462 --> 01:26:43.331
Yes, where would
we chemists be

01:26:43.331 --> 01:26:46.100
without the steadying hand
of the physicist?

01:27:01.583 --> 01:27:05.820
WOMAN:
It took years, but Lise lost
her shyness eventually.

01:27:05.820 --> 01:27:08.456
In 1912, she and Hahn moved

01:27:08.456 --> 01:27:11.559
to the brand-new Kaiser Wilhelm
Institute for Chemistry,

01:27:11.559 --> 01:27:14.295
where their status
was really that of equals.

01:27:17.165 --> 01:27:19.200
Lise became the first woman
in Germany ever

01:27:19.200 --> 01:27:21.636
to have the title of professor.

01:27:39.754 --> 01:27:44.492
Lise... I have news.

01:27:46.294 --> 01:27:47.328
Oh?

01:27:47.328 --> 01:27:49.063
You remember the art student

01:27:49.063 --> 01:27:50.331
I told you of?

01:27:50.331 --> 01:27:52.267
Yes, Edith.

01:27:52.267 --> 01:27:57.038
Yes, well, I have, um...

01:27:57.038 --> 01:27:59.240
asked her to marry me,
and she has accepted.

01:28:03.144 --> 01:28:04.412
Oh...

01:28:04.412 --> 01:28:06.914
Oh, Dr. Hahn,
congratulations.

01:28:08.950 --> 01:28:11.386
Yes, well...

01:28:11.386 --> 01:28:14.522
I wanted you to be
the first to know.

01:28:14.522 --> 01:28:18.259
I'm very pleased for you.

01:28:20.662 --> 01:28:22.230
Very pleased.

01:28:30.905 --> 01:28:33.441
SIME:
Lise Meitner
was warm-hearted by nature.

01:28:33.441 --> 01:28:36.177
She had many friends

01:28:36.177 --> 01:28:40.615
and she may have wanted to have
a closer relationship with Otto.

01:28:40.615 --> 01:28:44.886
But it really does seem that
physics was Lise's first love--

01:28:44.886 --> 01:28:46.821
maybe even her passion.

01:28:49.257 --> 01:28:54.262
LITHGOW:
The 1920s and '30s were the
golden age of nuclear research.

01:28:54.262 --> 01:28:56.631
The largest known nucleus
at the time

01:28:56.631 --> 01:28:58.966
was that of the uranium atom,

01:28:58.966 --> 01:29:02.970
containing
238 protons and neutrons.

01:29:02.970 --> 01:29:04.906
Meitner and Hahn
were leading the race

01:29:04.906 --> 01:29:07.909
to see if even bigger nuclei
could be created

01:29:07.909 --> 01:29:10.978
by adding more neutrons.

01:29:10.978 --> 01:29:15.616
So... the atom, pretty familiar:

01:29:15.616 --> 01:29:21.089
Nucleus in the center,
electrons... orbiting around.

01:29:23.624 --> 01:29:26.127
The nucleus is our focus.

01:29:26.127 --> 01:29:32.066
The nucleus, made up
of protons... and neutrons.

01:29:32.066 --> 01:29:35.303
Now, the largest nucleus
that we know

01:29:35.303 --> 01:29:37.872
is that of the uranium atom.

01:29:37.872 --> 01:29:41.576
Its nucleus is
a tightly packed structure

01:29:41.576 --> 01:29:47.749
of 238 protons and neutrons.

01:29:47.749 --> 01:29:54.489
The thrust of our work
is to try to fire neutrons

01:29:54.489 --> 01:29:57.892
into this huge structure,

01:29:57.892 --> 01:30:02.463
and if we can get a neutron
to stick in here,

01:30:02.463 --> 01:30:05.500
that will be a breakthrough.

01:30:15.977 --> 01:30:19.781
LITHGOW:
Meitner may have been on
the brink of a major discovery,

01:30:19.781 --> 01:30:24.051
but Germany in the 1930s
was a dangerous place to be,

01:30:24.051 --> 01:30:26.754
even for a world-class
scientist.

01:30:28.456 --> 01:30:30.691
The Jewess endangers
our institute.

01:30:35.696 --> 01:30:38.433
When the Nazis came to power,
one of the first things they did

01:30:38.433 --> 01:30:42.570
was to drive out Jewish
academics from the universities.

01:30:42.570 --> 01:30:44.705
Einstein was very prominent

01:30:44.705 --> 01:30:47.408
and for that reason
he was one of the first to go.

01:30:47.408 --> 01:30:50.845
He was hounded out of Germany
in 1933.

01:30:50.845 --> 01:30:54.415
Lise was not dismissed
at that time.

01:30:54.415 --> 01:30:57.852
She was able to stay
because she was Austrian.

01:30:57.852 --> 01:31:01.522
But in March 1938,
Austria was annexed into Germany

01:31:01.522 --> 01:31:06.027
and at that point her situation
became untenable.

01:31:06.027 --> 01:31:08.229
( inaudible )

01:31:13.568 --> 01:31:15.336
What is it?

01:31:19.540 --> 01:31:20.875
Frightening news.

01:31:20.875 --> 01:31:22.577
What's happened?

01:31:24.846 --> 01:31:27.548
Kurt Hess is going around saying
that I should be got rid of.

01:31:30.184 --> 01:31:32.587
I, um... I actually knew.

01:31:32.587 --> 01:31:33.588
I heard today.

01:31:33.588 --> 01:31:34.755
I was going to speak

01:31:34.755 --> 01:31:36.390
to the treasurer
of the institute

01:31:36.390 --> 01:31:37.925
before I told you.

01:31:37.925 --> 01:31:39.760
We're speaking tomorrow.

01:31:42.296 --> 01:31:43.965
Come on,
let's get you home.

01:31:43.965 --> 01:31:45.933
It's late.

01:31:51.472 --> 01:31:53.207
We'll finish up.

01:31:55.076 --> 01:31:58.145
LITHGOW:
The pressure on Meitner
was unbearable.

01:31:58.145 --> 01:32:01.816
Hahn, who was known
for his anti-Nazi views,

01:32:01.816 --> 01:32:05.453
did his best to protect her,
at least initially.

01:32:07.221 --> 01:32:08.589
I need to talk to you
about Lise.

01:32:08.589 --> 01:32:10.191
Not now,
I'm too busy.

01:32:10.191 --> 01:32:11.826
We have to protect her.

01:32:11.826 --> 01:32:13.895
( sighs )

01:32:13.895 --> 01:32:15.796
How?

01:32:15.796 --> 01:32:18.032
What can we do?

01:32:18.032 --> 01:32:20.101
The situation
is the way it is.

01:32:20.101 --> 01:32:22.503
Who knows what
will happen next?

01:32:22.503 --> 01:32:25.473
She can't stay;
it's just not tenable.

01:32:25.473 --> 01:32:28.309
But she hasn't got a visa
or even a valid passport.

01:32:28.309 --> 01:32:31.178
And she may soon be
forbidden to leave Germany.

01:32:34.215 --> 01:32:37.184
We can't harbor a Jew.

01:32:37.184 --> 01:32:41.489
If she stays, the regime
will shut us all down!

01:32:51.699 --> 01:32:52.733
Lise...

01:32:58.105 --> 01:33:01.442
Horlein demands
that you leave.

01:33:03.110 --> 01:33:05.546
You can't
throw her out.

01:33:08.749 --> 01:33:10.918
Horlein says
you should not come

01:33:10.918 --> 01:33:12.587
into the institute
anymore.

01:33:14.989 --> 01:33:16.223
Well, I have to write up

01:33:16.223 --> 01:33:19.026
the thorium irradiation
tomorrow,

01:33:19.026 --> 01:33:20.261
so I have to come in.

01:33:20.261 --> 01:33:22.997
You've given up.

01:33:41.482 --> 01:33:44.285
LITHGOW:
When it became clear that
Meitner would be dismissed

01:33:44.285 --> 01:33:46.020
and probably arrested,

01:33:46.020 --> 01:33:48.823
physicists all around Europe
wrote letters

01:33:48.823 --> 01:33:50.791
inviting her to conferences,

01:33:50.791 --> 01:33:53.394
giving her an excuse
to leave Germany.

01:33:53.394 --> 01:33:56.163
The Nazis refused to let her go.

01:33:57.398 --> 01:34:00.468
In July of 1938,

01:34:00.468 --> 01:34:02.470
a Dutch colleague
traveled to Berlin

01:34:02.470 --> 01:34:05.272
and illegally took Lise
back with him

01:34:05.272 --> 01:34:06.907
on a train to Holland.

01:34:06.907 --> 01:34:08.676
The trip was so frightening

01:34:08.676 --> 01:34:11.445
that at one point
she begged to go back.

01:34:11.445 --> 01:34:15.516
Despite the great danger,
she got through.

01:34:23.357 --> 01:34:27.294
SIME:
She had lost everything--
her home, her position,

01:34:27.294 --> 01:34:30.765
her books,
her salary, her pension,

01:34:30.765 --> 01:34:34.568
even her native language.

01:34:34.568 --> 01:34:37.905
She had been cut off
from her work just at the time

01:34:37.905 --> 01:34:39.373
when she was leading the field

01:34:39.373 --> 01:34:43.377
and was on the brink of
a major scientific discovery.

01:34:45.646 --> 01:34:48.315
LITHGOW:
No matter what
privations she suffered,

01:34:48.315 --> 01:34:51.585
Lise was still thinking
of physics.

01:34:51.585 --> 01:34:57.425
Amazingly, she and Hahn were
able to collaborate by letter.

01:34:57.425 --> 01:35:00.895
MEITNER ( composing ):
I hope, my dear Otto,
that after 30 years

01:35:00.895 --> 01:35:03.531
of work together and friendship
in the institute,

01:35:03.531 --> 01:35:05.966
that at least
the possibility remains

01:35:05.966 --> 01:35:07.835
that you tell me
as much as you can

01:35:07.835 --> 01:35:10.071
about what
is happening back there.

01:35:29.890 --> 01:35:32.960
SIME:
Lise was invited by
an old student friend

01:35:32.960 --> 01:35:36.897
to spend Christmas
on the west coast of Sweden.

01:35:36.897 --> 01:35:41.702
Her nephew, Otto Robert Frisch,
who was also a physicist,

01:35:41.702 --> 01:35:43.204
came to join her there.

01:35:43.204 --> 01:35:45.906
Aunt?

01:35:45.906 --> 01:35:49.610
Aunt?

01:35:49.610 --> 01:35:51.746
Aunt?

01:35:51.746 --> 01:35:53.514
Lise, how are you,
my dear?

01:35:56.183 --> 01:35:57.685
Merry Christmas.

01:35:57.685 --> 01:35:59.253
Aunt?

01:35:59.253 --> 01:36:01.122
Hmm, I need your help.

01:36:01.122 --> 01:36:03.090
Come on, let's go out.

01:36:03.858 --> 01:36:06.293
But I was
hoping you'd help me.

01:36:10.998 --> 01:36:15.035
LITHGOW:
Back in Berlin, Hahn
was getting strange results.

01:36:15.035 --> 01:36:16.937
He found no evidence
to suggest

01:36:16.937 --> 01:36:19.840
that bombarding the uranium
nucleus with neutrons

01:36:19.840 --> 01:36:22.343
had caused it
to increase in size.

01:36:22.343 --> 01:36:26.080
In fact, his experiments
seemed to be contaminated

01:36:26.080 --> 01:36:29.083
with radium, a smaller atom.

01:36:29.083 --> 01:36:33.587
He desperately needed
Meitner's expert analysis.

01:36:33.587 --> 01:36:35.523
From afar,
she was starting to suspect

01:36:35.523 --> 01:36:37.424
that something very different
was happening

01:36:37.424 --> 01:36:38.959
in their experiment.

01:36:41.228 --> 01:36:43.998
Hahn and Strassman are getting
some strange results

01:36:43.998 --> 01:36:45.065
with the uranium work.

01:36:45.065 --> 01:36:46.433
Really?

01:36:46.433 --> 01:36:48.435
A couple of months ago,
Hahn told me

01:36:48.435 --> 01:36:52.640
that they were finding radium
amongst the uranium products.

01:36:52.640 --> 01:36:54.708
We are looking for
a much bigger element,

01:36:54.708 --> 01:36:58.846
and... here we're finding
something much smaller.

01:36:58.846 --> 01:37:03.250
I urged Hahn to check again--
it couldn't be radium.

01:37:03.250 --> 01:37:04.785
And now he writes to me

01:37:04.785 --> 01:37:08.589
and tells me that
it's not radium,
it's barium.

01:37:08.589 --> 01:37:10.124
But that's even smaller.

01:37:10.124 --> 01:37:11.759
Exactly.

01:37:11.759 --> 01:37:14.361
Hahn is sure
that it's another error,

01:37:14.361 --> 01:37:16.096
but I don't know anymore.

01:37:16.096 --> 01:37:19.133
It is at least possible that
barium is being produced.

01:37:19.133 --> 01:37:21.502
So Hahn still needs you
to interpret the data.

01:37:21.502 --> 01:37:24.605
It is my work, too, you know.

01:37:24.605 --> 01:37:26.640
Exactly.

01:37:26.640 --> 01:37:30.644
Well, I can't be there, can I?

01:37:33.514 --> 01:37:35.549
Come on, let's walk.

01:37:43.591 --> 01:37:46.360
Surely he's made
a mistake, hasn't he?

01:37:46.360 --> 01:37:48.362
He hasn't done
what you told him to.

01:37:48.362 --> 01:37:49.530
My darling Robert,

01:37:49.530 --> 01:37:51.532
he may not be
a brilliant theorist,

01:37:51.532 --> 01:37:55.436
but he's
too good a chemist
to get this wrong.

01:38:02.176 --> 01:38:04.678
SIME:
If you imagine a drop of water--
a big drop--

01:38:04.678 --> 01:38:09.183
it's unstable, on the verge
of breaking apart.

01:38:09.183 --> 01:38:11.552
It turns out
that a big nucleus like uranium

01:38:11.552 --> 01:38:13.454
is just like that.

01:38:13.454 --> 01:38:16.023
Now for four years,
Meitner and Hahn

01:38:16.023 --> 01:38:18.125
and all other physicists
had thought

01:38:18.125 --> 01:38:21.028
that if you pump more neutrons
into this nucleus,

01:38:21.028 --> 01:38:23.697
it'll just get
bigger and heavier.

01:38:26.834 --> 01:38:29.069
But suddenly,
Meitner and Frisch--

01:38:29.069 --> 01:38:32.006
out in the midday snow--
realized

01:38:32.006 --> 01:38:34.208
this nucleus
might just get so big

01:38:34.208 --> 01:38:35.743
that it would split in two.

01:38:42.549 --> 01:38:46.387
If the nucleus is so big that
it has trouble staying together,

01:38:46.387 --> 01:38:51.225
then couldn't just a little,
tiny jog from a neutron...

01:38:51.225 --> 01:38:52.860
Yes, but if the nucleus
did split,

01:38:52.860 --> 01:38:55.529
the two halves would fly apart
with a huge amount of energy.

01:38:55.529 --> 01:38:59.066
Where's that energy going
to come from?

01:38:59.066 --> 01:39:01.268
How much energy?

01:39:01.268 --> 01:39:04.872
Well, we worked out that
the mutual repulsion
between two nuclei

01:39:04.872 --> 01:39:07.107
would generate
about 200 million
electron volts.

01:39:07.107 --> 01:39:10.411
But something
has to supply that energy.

01:39:10.411 --> 01:39:13.714
Wait, let me do
a packing fraction calculation.

01:39:20.888 --> 01:39:23.057
The two nuclei

01:39:23.057 --> 01:39:27.061
are lighter than the original
nucleus of the uranium

01:39:27.061 --> 01:39:29.363
by about one-fifth
of a proton in mass.

01:39:29.363 --> 01:39:31.432
What?

01:39:31.432 --> 01:39:32.900
So some mass has been lost.

01:39:35.135 --> 01:39:37.371
Einstein's
E equals m c-squared.

01:39:39.406 --> 01:39:44.611
If we multiply the lost mass
by the speed of light squared

01:39:44.611 --> 01:39:45.679
we get...

01:39:45.679 --> 01:39:47.247
( scribbling )

01:39:49.883 --> 01:39:52.286
200 million electron volts.

01:39:53.687 --> 01:39:56.824
He's split the atom.

01:39:56.824 --> 01:39:58.993
No, no, no...

01:39:58.993 --> 01:40:00.661
you've split the atom.

01:40:08.869 --> 01:40:12.773
SIME:
It was an amazing discovery.

01:40:12.773 --> 01:40:14.008
Of course, in the laboratory

01:40:14.008 --> 01:40:16.143
we're talking about
tiny amounts of uranium

01:40:16.143 --> 01:40:19.346
and correspondingly
tiny amounts of energy.

01:40:19.346 --> 01:40:22.249
But the point is that
the amount of energy released

01:40:22.249 --> 01:40:24.218
was relatively large

01:40:24.218 --> 01:40:27.488
and that came from
the mass of the uranium itself.

01:40:27.488 --> 01:40:30.924
The energy released
was entirely consistent

01:40:30.924 --> 01:40:35.129
with Einstein's equation
E equals m c-squared.

01:40:38.532 --> 01:40:41.168
LITHGOW:
Meitner and Frisch
published the discovery

01:40:41.168 --> 01:40:43.637
of what they called
nuclear fission

01:40:43.637 --> 01:40:45.339
to great acclaim.

01:40:45.339 --> 01:40:48.375
But betrayal awaited them.

01:40:51.078 --> 01:40:53.914
Otto Hahn was under pressure
from the Nazi regime

01:40:53.914 --> 01:40:57.317
to write his Jewish colleague
out of the story.

01:40:57.317 --> 01:41:01.955
He alone was awarded the 1944
Nobel Prize for the discovery.

01:41:01.955 --> 01:41:04.458
In his speech,
he barely mentioned

01:41:04.458 --> 01:41:06.760
the leading role of Meitner.

01:41:06.760 --> 01:41:09.763
Bizarrely, even after the war,

01:41:09.763 --> 01:41:13.634
Hahn maintained it
was he and not Meitner

01:41:13.634 --> 01:41:16.203
who had discovered
nuclear fission.

01:41:16.203 --> 01:41:19.907
MEITNER ( composing ):
Now, I want to write
something personal,

01:41:19.907 --> 01:41:24.411
which disturbs me
and which I ask you to read

01:41:24.411 --> 01:41:27.281
with our more than
40-year friendship in mind

01:41:27.281 --> 01:41:30.517
and with the desire
to understand me.

01:41:30.517 --> 01:41:35.989
I am now referred to
as Hahn's long-time co-worker.

01:41:35.989 --> 01:41:39.026
How would you feel
if you were only characterized

01:41:39.026 --> 01:41:42.162
as the long-time
co-worker of me?

01:41:44.731 --> 01:41:46.600
After the last 15 years--

01:41:46.600 --> 01:41:50.471
which I wouldn't wish
on any good friend--

01:41:50.471 --> 01:41:55.809
shall my scientific past
also be taken from me?

01:41:55.809 --> 01:41:58.345
Is that fair?

01:41:58.345 --> 01:42:00.781
And why is it happening?

01:42:06.987 --> 01:42:10.457
BODANIS:
Lise Meitner had been working
on this for 30 years.

01:42:10.457 --> 01:42:13.460
She'd only broken apart
a handful of atoms,

01:42:13.460 --> 01:42:15.229
but that was enough.

01:42:15.229 --> 01:42:18.599
Once she had broken even one,
the genie was out of the bottle.

01:42:20.734 --> 01:42:22.736
What Meitner had started...
after that,

01:42:22.736 --> 01:42:24.238
physicists around the world

01:42:24.238 --> 01:42:28.142
began to realize they could
take it a lot further.

01:42:28.142 --> 01:42:32.212
LITHGOW:
In 1942, an intense effort
to build an atom bomb was begun.

01:42:32.212 --> 01:42:35.315
All over America,
secret installations sprang up

01:42:35.315 --> 01:42:39.820
under the code name
the Manhattan Project.

01:42:39.820 --> 01:42:42.156
Meitner was asked to join
the Manhattan Project,

01:42:42.156 --> 01:42:43.323
and she refused.

01:42:43.323 --> 01:42:46.093
She refused to have anything
to do with the atomic bomb.

01:42:46.093 --> 01:42:47.761
But Robert Frisch was different.

01:42:47.761 --> 01:42:50.130
He was an important member
of the team,

01:42:50.130 --> 01:42:52.065
because he was convinced
of the need

01:42:52.065 --> 01:42:54.835
to beat the Nazis
in a nuclear arms race.

01:43:11.218 --> 01:43:14.288
LITHGOW:
A nuclear bomb was
never used on Germany,

01:43:14.288 --> 01:43:18.592
but the atomic bombs dropped
on Hiroshima and Nagasaki

01:43:18.592 --> 01:43:21.995
demonstrated the terrible
destructive power

01:43:21.995 --> 01:43:24.331
of E equals m c-squared.

01:43:38.979 --> 01:43:41.215
Vast amounts of energy,

01:43:41.215 --> 01:43:43.650
in the form
of electromagnetic radiation,

01:43:43.650 --> 01:43:47.888
were released from a few pounds
of uranium and plutonium.

01:43:56.463 --> 01:43:58.765
While the pure inquisitiveness

01:43:58.765 --> 01:44:01.068
of the world's
most gifted scientists

01:44:01.068 --> 01:44:05.405
ironically had brought humanity
a weapon of mass destruction,

01:44:05.405 --> 01:44:08.675
the equation's life
has a parallel story

01:44:08.675 --> 01:44:11.845
of creation and beauty.

01:44:28.161 --> 01:44:31.732
Today, young physicists
carry on Einstein's quest.

01:44:31.732 --> 01:44:33.967
Ever since its birth,

01:44:33.967 --> 01:44:36.436
E equals m c-squared
has been used

01:44:36.436 --> 01:44:39.406
to delve into the depths
of time,

01:44:39.406 --> 01:44:41.842
to answer the biggest question
of all--

01:44:41.842 --> 01:44:43.644
where did we come from?

01:44:51.718 --> 01:44:54.354
At particle accelerators,

01:44:54.354 --> 01:44:56.890
researchers propel
atomic particles

01:44:56.890 --> 01:45:00.427
to the speed of light
and smash them together,

01:45:00.427 --> 01:45:03.563
creating conditions
like those in the Big Bang.

01:45:05.365 --> 01:45:07.634
KAISER:
E equals m c-squared
actually tells us

01:45:07.634 --> 01:45:10.103
how the Big Bang itself
happened.

01:45:13.874 --> 01:45:15.475
In the first moments
of creation,

01:45:15.475 --> 01:45:17.477
the universe was
this immensely dense,

01:45:17.477 --> 01:45:20.480
immensely concentrated eruption
of energy.

01:45:20.480 --> 01:45:24.618
As it rushed apart and expanded,
huge amounts of energy, or E,

01:45:24.618 --> 01:45:26.553
were converted
into mass, or m.

01:45:26.553 --> 01:45:28.255
Pure energy became matter--

01:45:28.255 --> 01:45:29.856
it became the particles
and atoms

01:45:29.856 --> 01:45:32.359
and it eventually formed
the first stars.

01:45:36.730 --> 01:45:39.733
BODANIS:
Our sun is a huge furnace
floating in space

01:45:39.733 --> 01:45:42.302
and it's powered
by E equals m c-squared.

01:45:43.570 --> 01:45:45.339
Now it turns out, every second,

01:45:45.339 --> 01:45:49.609
four million tons of solid mass
of the sun disappears.

01:45:49.609 --> 01:45:50.977
It comes out as energy.

01:45:50.977 --> 01:45:52.446
Not just a little bit of energy.

01:45:52.446 --> 01:45:55.082
It's enough to light up
our entire solar system,

01:45:55.082 --> 01:45:57.784
make the solar system
glow with heat and light.

01:45:59.786 --> 01:46:01.788
KAKU:
And not only
do stars emit energy,

01:46:01.788 --> 01:46:04.991
in accordance
with E equals m c-squared.

01:46:04.991 --> 01:46:09.863
The whole process
actually creates life itself.

01:46:11.732 --> 01:46:14.901
Eventually, a massive star dies,

01:46:14.901 --> 01:46:18.338
the debris floats around,
clusters together,

01:46:18.338 --> 01:46:20.807
gets pulled into the orbits
of another star

01:46:20.807 --> 01:46:23.043
and becomes a planet.

01:46:25.011 --> 01:46:30.217
We humans and the earth we
stand on are made of stardust.

01:46:30.217 --> 01:46:35.155
We are a direct product
of E equals m c-squared.

01:46:38.558 --> 01:46:43.330
LITHGOW:
Building on the work
of scientists through the ages,

01:46:43.330 --> 01:46:46.333
new generations are searching
for answers.

01:46:47.934 --> 01:46:52.172
Using bold new tools that reach
almost to the speed of light,

01:46:52.172 --> 01:46:53.974
they can now ask questions

01:46:53.974 --> 01:46:57.244
that their predecessors
could never have even imagined.

01:47:06.686 --> 01:47:08.755
As Einstein himself knew,

01:47:08.755 --> 01:47:12.459
the journey of discovery
is sometimes painful,

01:47:12.459 --> 01:47:14.795
sometimes joyful.

01:47:14.795 --> 01:47:18.732
It is as old
as human curiosity itself

01:47:18.732 --> 01:47:22.335
and never, ever ends.

01:47:24.137 --> 01:47:26.973
( train whistle blowing )

01:47:57.938 --> 01:47:59.973
