py-caption
==========

|Build Status| |Pre-Commit|

``pycaption`` is a caption reading/writing module. Use one of the given Readers
to read content into a CaptionSet object, and then use one of the Writers to
output the CaptionSet into captions of your desired format.

Tested with Python versions 3.6, 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9.
(for Python 2 use pycaption < 1.0.0)

For details, see the `documentation <http://pycaption.readthedocs.org>`__.
